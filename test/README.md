# Template NexusML – A Simple MLOps Framework

## Overview

NexusML is a highly modular and scalable MLOps framework designed to integrate deep learning models seamlessly into end-to-end machine learning pipelines. Unlike traditional approaches where the model dominates the workflow, NexusML treats the model as a central yet interchangeable component within a robust ecosystem of data pipelines, serving pipelines, and monitoring pipelines.

This project aims to provide a generalized MLOps solution that supports various machine learning models, enabling easy adaptation across different domains and architectures.

## Key Features

:white_check_mark: Modular Design – Easily swap different models while keeping the MLOps pipeline intact.

:white_check_mark: Data Pipeline Integration – Supports real-time and batch data processing with Kafka, Airflow, and PostgreSQL.

:white_check_mark: Model Serving – Deploy models efficiently with FastAPI, optimized for both batch inference and real-time predictions.

:white_check_mark: Continuous Monitoring – Track performance, detect data drift, and log experiments using Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and MLflow.

:white_check_mark: CI/CD for MLOps – Automate deployment and model retraining with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and MLflow Model Registry.

:white_check_mark: Scalability & Flexibility – Designed for deep learning, but extensible for any ML model, from classical to transformer-based architectures.

## Tech Stack
