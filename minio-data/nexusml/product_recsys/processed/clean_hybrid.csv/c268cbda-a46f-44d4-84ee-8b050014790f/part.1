130,21,"paperwhite voyage, no regrets! i initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing: the paperwhite is great, but if you have spending money, go for the voyage.fortunately, i had friends who owned each, so i ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis: both models now have 300 ppi, so the 80 dollar jump turns out pricey the voyage's page press isn't always sensitive, and if you are fine with a specific setting, you don't need auto light adjustment).it's been a week and i am loving my paperwhite, no regrets! the touch screen is receptive and easy to use, and i keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day. (in any case, it's not hard to change the setting either, as you'll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day, not every now and then while reading).also glad that i went for the international shipping option with amazon. extra expense, but delivery was on time, with tracking, and i didnt need to worry about customs, which i may have if i used a third party shipping service. kindle paperwhite amazon amazon devices,mazon.co.uk",5.0
530,21,"one simply could not ask for more allow me to preface this with a little history. i am (was) a casual reader who owned a nook simple touch from 2011. i've read the harry potter series, girl with the dragon tattoo series, 1984, brave new world, and a few other key titles. fair to say my nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.fast forward to today. i have had a full week with my new kindle paperwhite and i have to admit, i'm in love. not just with the kindle, but with reading all over again! now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the kindle. the investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a kindle. you are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from amazon.i have been reading the hunger games trilogy and shall be moving onto the divergent series soon after. here is the thing with the nook that hindered me for the past 4 years: i was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. there was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. however, with my paperwhite, i now have that feeling! that desire is back and i simply adore my kindle. if you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. after a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, i still have half of my battery left as well.make yourself happy. inspire the reader inside of you. kindle paperwhite amazon amazon devices,mazon.co.uk",5.0
627,21,"great for those that just want an e-reader i am enjoying it so far. great for reading. had the original fire since 2012. the fire used to make my eyes hurt if i read too long. haven't experienced that with the paperwhite yet. kindle paperwhite amazon amazon devices,mazon.co.uk",4.0
187,21,"love / hate relationship i bought one of the first paperwhites and have been very pleased with it its been a constant companion and i suppose ive read, on average, a book every three days for the past however many years on it. i wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingers.for sundry logistical reasons, ive also made good use of amazons kindle app on my iphone. no paperwhite screen, naturally, and all the cool usability that delivers, but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the kindle.of course, there are aspects of the paperwhite which i would like to critique. ah you knew that was coming somewhere, didnt you.as a member of bookbub, i get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres. i take on many of them, however, ive found that, even with the best will in the world, i cant keep up. some days it seems that for every book i read, ive bought two. theres just so much good stuff out there! the accumulative effect of this is that the number of books actually on my paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time. its now at about 400.with this in mind, ive noticed that while page-turning has remained exactly the same, just about every other action on the kindle has become positively glacial. not just very slow, but so slow you think its malfunctioning. the general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a kindle, it will begin to behave in a flakey manner. this drives me mad. amazon states it can hold thousands of books. i believe them. but i figure i would need a second paperwhite to read while im waiting for actions to complete on the first one.read more kindle paperwhite amazon amazon devices,mazon.co.uk",5.0
445,21,"i love it i have to say upfront - i don't like coroporate, hermetically closed stuff like anything by apple or in this case, amazon. i like having devices on which i can put anything i want and use it. but...i was a fairly happy user of a nook touch for several years, but couldn't use all its functionalities since i live in serbia. then i lost the nook and since no other devices can actually be fully used in serbia (buying books with them, using their online capabilities) except the kindle, and since no one except amazon ships to serbia, and since i've actually been a happy amazon customer since 2005 over friends' accounts and since 2007 through my own, and since the kindle definitely has the best technology - why not buy itso i did. what i read in many reviews about the screen/light of the paperwhite and similar devices was no problem with mine. the light disperses just fine, except a few black blotches (maybe you can see it in the picture) at the bottom of the screen, which are actually shadows of the black plastic casing and thus can't really be avoided. as you can see in the picture without the light - there are no blotches with light out.the paperwhite's screen is just marvelous at 300 ppi, the touchscreen works just fine, the store works here in serbia, and in these two days i've been using it, i'm a happy guy.i had to get the hang on how to make sideloaded books behave at least almost like amazon books, but that's fine. that's the one thing i'd like to see amazon do in some future upgrades: make the kindle treat sideloaded books just like the ones bought from them directly, with sharing funcion (quotes and goodreads) enabled and so on.the size is perfect, it sits very well in the hand, the light doesn't hurt the eyes in the dark (like the light on a tab does)... the packaging was fine, no problems there and what remains to be seen now is the battery life.so far, i can only recommend it. kindle paperwhite amazon amazon devices,mazon.co.uk",5.0

327,21,"superb reading device - but which one's best for you this is a review of the kindle paperwhite launched july 2015. essentially. the same as the previous kindle paperwhite but with a fantastic upgraded (300 dpi) screen, more memory and storage it's a terrific reading device. this review aims to describe both this product, and compare it with the other kindle devices available to help you choose the best one for you.before i start, ive noticed several complains about kindle not supporting the epub format used by canadian public libraries. dont be put off, theres a solution in the frequently asked questions section below.this review is broken up into sections so you can skip the less interesting bits. if youre in a hurry ive included a summary at the start, and a frequently asked questions section at the end.summary - what can you do with it-----------------------------------------* read a book. it can store 1,000s of books - take an entire library away with you on holiday.* buy a book. you can browse the amazon kindle store, and buy books over a wifi connection* borrow a book. using the kindle owners library you can borrow one of 60,000 books (if you have amazon prime membership)* share your books. using amazon family library to link two amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family* highlight a section. using the touch screen, you can highlight a particulary interesting few lines. if several people highlight the same section, that's also indicated.* record a bookmark. to come back to it later* read a book on your kindle, continue on your smartphone or tablet computer, and it will jump to your last known position* look up a word, and record them in the vocabulary builder* track a characters appearance throughout a book using the x ray feature.* read for weeks without needing to recharge - typically 4-6 weeks* share you books (multiple kindles on the same account, or family sharing)* access every book you've ever owned on the cloud - available for download within seconds over wifi or 3g..what devices are available--------------------------------as of july 2015, amazon have the following kindle devices on sale:-1. kindle 6 (around cdn 79)2. kindle paperwhite 6th generation (212 dpi - launched october 2013) - around cdn 1292. new kindle paperwhite 7th gen (300 dpi - launched july 2015) - around cdn 139-2093. kindle voyger - around us 219-289 (doesnt seem to be on sale in amazon canada)4. kindle fire - 6 or 7 colour tablet computers at around cdn 300-400so you're faced with a few devices, plus additional options. which to buy here's a quick summary in order of cost.*** the entry level kindle ***an entry level black and white (e-ink) book reader, it has a 6 inch touch screen with enough storage to hold thousands of books, and a battery which should last around 4 weeks.a terrific device to read books, and a worthy contender. for the technically minded, it has a 1ghz processor and 4gb of memory with an e-ink display. essentially this means it's (a) black and white (b) fantastic to read even in bright sunlight (c) requires very little power - hence the battery lasts for weeks instead of hours.*** new kindle paperwhite ***launched in 2015, this is really an upgrade adding a super-sharp display with 300 pixels per inch - the same as the top of the range voyage. the high resolution screen does provide a crisp text which is pleasing to the eye, but battery life is reduced from 8 weeks of the original paperwhite to 6 weeks - but still a very long time.compared to the existing (2013) paperwhite it also includes double the memory which means its faster and slicker than before, and a new bookerly font plus better presentation of fonts on screen.if you have an existing paperwhite its probably not worth upgrading. however, if you own a prior device, youll notice the huge leap in screen quality, contrast and performance.*** the voyage ***far more expensive that paperwhite, this is thinner and 26g lighter. it has more of a quality feel with the screen flush with the e-reader body which makes it look more like a tablet, and keeps dirt from getting caught in the edges. the back has a soft touch plastic finish which feels lovely in the hand, and it has new page press buttons on the side to turn the pages. when the buttons are pressed theres a gentle vibration for feedback (nice touch). it has 4gb of storage (same as the paperwhite), and a similar battery which should last around 6 weeks on a single charge.although it has the same sharp (300 dpi) screen as the paperwhite, the backlight includes an ambient light sensor so it automatically adjusts to different lighting conditions. this means if you read it the dark it will automatically adjust the brightness so it doesnt look too bright. in addition, youll find when you switch off the room light your eyes naturally become accustomed to the darkness. to compensate, the voyage automatically softens the light slightly. a lovely example of attention to detail in this premium device.*** kindle fire tablet computer ***the kindle fire range is a very different beast to the rest of the kindle range. similar to the apple ipad mini, it has a high resolution screen, a fast processor and lots of memory with a colour screen and a much shorter battery life - hours rather than weeks. although you can read books on a fire using the amazon kindle app, youll find the kindle with its sharp black and white screen far more like reading a physical book. youll find it produces less eye strain, and whereas a tablet computer is better suited to surfing the web, watching videos and reading emails, the kindle is a dedicated book reader device.unlike a kindle, the fire produces light at the blue end of the spectrum which means it may make it harder for you to sleep. the paperwhite and voyage also ave the advantage of a soft white back-light which is far more suited to reading in bed, and it wont for example, wake your partner if reading in the dark.finally, unlike the rest of the kindle range, the fire is almost useless in bright sunlight so while its fine for everyday use, its less useful on holiday. the kindle range of devices are perfect to take away on holiday as they can carry thousands of books, and are a pleasure to read even in bright sunlight.what other options do i have----------------------------------having decided upon the model (kindle, paperwhite, voyage or fire), the next decision is around:-* special offers - ie. adverts* 3g or wifi connectionpersonally i have no issue with adverts on a kindle. they only appear on screen when the screen saver is on, and are not at all distracting.the 3g option is a more difficult question. this effectively means you can use your kindle to buy or download books over-the-air instead of at home or near a wifi hotspot. personally i went for the wifi model as the saving is considerable, but its a personal choice. of course if you wont have wifi at home, then youll need the 3g option.one point worth mentioning however, is if you have a modern smartphone, you can always create a personal hotspot or local wifi signal that your kindle (or indeed any other wifi device) can connect to. got to settings personal hotspot on your mobile to set one up, and you can connect your wifi only kindle while youre out and about.conclusion-------------if you love books but your on a budget, the original kindle with wifi and special offers is a great option. youll still be able to carry thousands of book around with you, but youll lose out on the soft white back-light and super crisp display of the papwerwhite.the kindle paperwhite is your next best option and is a terrific device for reading with a superb 300 dpi super-sharp screen. finally, theres the top of the range voyage with the page press buttons and ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the brightness.if youre in the market for a tablet computer then the kindle fire range is worth considering, but youll get a better book reading experience on the kindle. myself i have both a paperwhite and an ipad air 2. i was skeptical at first, but the kindle is a perfect device for reading with one hand (on the train), and the back-light and long battery life a huge bonus.frequently asked questions---------------------------------q: what file format will a kindle reada: kindle format 8 (azw3), kindle (azw), txt, pdf, unprotected mobi, prc natively in addition to html, doc, docx, jpeg, gif, png, bmp through conversionq: what it doesnt support epub formata: no - but you can convert your epub books using a freely available program called calibre. simple search for you tube um0teoar6zw and youll see a video explaining how to do this. simples.q: if i lose my kindle, do i lose my books as wella: no. all books are available on your amazon account to download on a new device.q: can i save my place in the booka: yes. it will automatically save your place, and if you resume on other device it will prompt you to jump to that position.q: i often need reading glasses - can i adjust the font sizea: yes. theres a range of fonts, and sizes to suit all tastesq: can i share books with my partner or childrena: yes. you can now share your books using amazon family library to link two amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire familyq. can i use a kindle to read in beda. yes. but only on the paperwhite and voyage models. its a pleasure to read in the dark with a soft white light. for the base kindle model youll need the light onq. are there any free books availablea. yes! over 40,000 classic titles are available for free (out of copyright), and they can be legally downloaded. if you have a amazon prime membership you can also borrow a book from the kindle owners library which includes around 60,000 books.q: how long does the battery lasta: depending upon model, you should get between 4 and 6 weeks between charges on around 30 minutes of reading per day. ive certainly found ive gone for weeks without charging the deviceq: how long does it take to chargea: from absolutely flat, around 4 hoursq: how many books will the kindle holda: literally thousands. you can also download every book youve ever owned from your amazon account - so the list is quite literally unlimited.q: do i need anything elsea: youll need a smartphone charger or laptop with a usb socket as the kindle range doesnt come with a charger (but the fire does). amazon also offer an additional charger to buy if you need it. some people also buy a cover, but i think this is not really needed. it adds to the weight, and is not really needed. it will protect your kindle from a drop however, and protect the screen if its left knocking around in a bag. kindle paperwhite amazon amazon devices,mazon.co.uk",5.0
810,21,"i love it! i love my kindle! i got one for my fiance on his birthday, he loved it!!!!!!! so i decided to get one for myself as well and i am glad i did. it is very easy to read books in it. i love the dictionary on this little device. normally i just skip a word i don't know the meaning of and try to guess what it means in the context but with kindle, i just press and hold my finger on the word i don't know and translation pops up! so essentially, the meaning of a new word is at your finger tips! )if you love to read books, i highly recommend kindle.however, if you only read manga or comic books, if you are a fan of buying how to draw, how to sew books i do not recommend kindle for you. it is not easy to navigate trough pictures and slides.so if you are a fan of reading novels just buy it now!if you are a manga fan, just buy your manga books from bookstores. kindle paperwhite amazon amazon devices,mazon.co.uk",5.0

309,37,"updated review (after 2 months)... i am updating my review from two months ago.. my initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it. today i have been using the tap and sling daily for over the last two months and i felt like i needed to modify my review. i originally did not recommend this product, but after living with it, and growing to like it, i am changing my recommendation.the truth is, the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe. i have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling. i think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall. also, it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling.i initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock, but it isn't as big of a problem as i thought it would be. i just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it (leaving the top of the sling on). easy off and easy back on after.my only real lingering complaint would be the price. 20 for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive. i am increasing my stars by one. really the price is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me. i have come to really like the sling. i have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it. that has eased my concerns about keeping it clean/safe while throwing it into a work bag.my original is below. overall, i would (and have) recommended the sling to protect the tap.received the tap and the sling cover in the last 24 hours.read more amazon tap sling cover - tangerine nan amazon devices",4.0

309,37,"updated review (after 2 months)... i am updating my review from two months ago.. my initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it. today i have been using the tap and sling daily for over the last two months and i felt like i needed to modify my review. i originally did not recommend this product, but after living with it, and growing to like it, i am changing my recommendation.the truth is, the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe. i have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling. i think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall. also, it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling.i initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock, but it isn't as big of a problem as i thought it would be. i just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it (leaving the top of the sling on). easy off and easy back on after.my only real lingering complaint would be the price. 20 for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive. i am increasing my stars by one. really the price is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me. i have come to really like the sling. i have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it. that has eased my concerns about keeping it clean/safe while throwing it into a work bag.my original is below. overall, i would (and have) recommended the sling to protect the tap.received the tap and the sling cover in the last 24 hours.read more amazon tap sling cover - blue nan amazon devices",4.0

96,37,"i also own a echo and if you own a echo you will love the tap ok first things first, i also own a echo and if you own a echo you will love the tap.now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the tap was voice enabled like the echo. i happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through. because the echo is not meant to be a mobile device. it generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have. but the tap is meant to be mobile, and therefore i am happy it's not a voice command device. i would not want to be at the beach or on a subway or at the coffee shop and having this thing think the world is taking to it. so i actually think not having a voice command is a well thought out feature. i have the echo on my kitchen counter and the tap in my studio office. and when i leave my office i just grab it and go.i bought this on sale for 89 and i went to the store and listened to many bluetooth speakers. and while yes the charge 3 sounds better, all the charge 3 can do is be a bluetooth speaker. while the tap is so much more for less . and the tap sounds great. after looking online i was a little nervous that it would not sound that great, but i was 100 wrong about that. there is no other product out there for 89 that sounds this good and can do what the tap does.i was not paid or given a tap to write this review. i'm just a consumer who was it the market for a bluetooth speaker, and i could not be happier with my choice.also if you buy this device buy the amazon sling as well. trust me you will want it. and honestly i am again happy i got the one that covers the bottom of the tap. because if this was sitting on a table and someone knocked over a drink i would not want the bottom where the charging rings are to be exposed.that's it, that's all. buy it, you won't be disappointed!!!!! amazon tap sling cover - blue nan amazon devices",5.0
135,44,"great upgrade for aesthetics i'm a huge fan of the echo family. i have two echo's, three dots and one tap. no they aren't essential to my life but i love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the philips hue smart lights throughout my home. it was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said i am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck dots look like. glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. having the dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - i'm not sure why people are moving their dots. since dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. to me, it fits perfectly. they also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your dot happens to get sunlight.i bought three covers - blue, grey and white. they all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. with that being said, i like all three colors.edit 07/11/2017 - these covers hold up well over time. mine haven't collected dust or faded. i've kept them on for over half a year and not a single issue (not that i'd expect any besides possible fading). amazon echo dot case (fits echo dot 2nd generation only) - sandstone fabric nan amazon devices",5.0

784,17,"does indeed work with shield tv :-) i have the original nvidia shield tv (not the latest 2017 version) and as such, i also have the older/bulkier controller that it came with. while it works alright, i was never that happy with it just because it's so large and clunky (i have smaller hands) and never got all that comfortable with it. so, i went searching for a replacement controller to use with it...along came the 2017 shield tv and a newly revamped controller. looks nice, got good reviews, but at this time, almost impossible to find one new or used for under 50 which is a bit more than i wanted to pay for a controller.i found the amazon fire tv controller searching around and wondered if it would work with the shield. turns out that the aft controller is not bluetooth, but rather, wi-fi direct. did a little more research and a few random searches led me to believe that you could indeed use this controller with a shield tv.since it's not bluetooth, trying to pair this controller with the shield (or any other bluetooth device) is impossible. but, at the suggestion of someone on an nvidia forum, if you go into the shield's settings and go to the add shield accessory setting, while holding the home button on the aft controller, after a few moments, indeed, it does connect and it does work. it doesn't show up as a shield accessory (since technically, it's not) so it's kinda weird that way. nowhere will you see in the shield's settings or options that the controller is even connected.after connecting or pairing the aft controller with my shield i noticed that i lost all sound and audio. the aft controller microphone works, but it basically caused me to lose all sound on my shield. needless to say that bummed me out.read more all-new amazon fire tv game controller nan amazon devices",4.0

291,14,"a great upgrade for me from an older kindle fire! 3, i purchased the original kindle fire in 2011 and the second generation kindle fire in 2012. i gave my original one to my grandson and he is still using it for apps and reading. i liked both of them and i have to tell you that they have held up very well. one is over 3 years old and the other is 2 years old and i have not had any issues with them. since i have not upgraded in 2 years i thought i would get a new one with a larger memory and a faster cpu and a higher resolution display. there are many improvements beyond even those features.i have to tell you that overall i am impressed with this new one. i didn't feel the need to purchase a kindle fire every year and when i purchased the next one i wanted it to be a definite upgrade step to what i had. i stayed with the 7 inch size as i like to portability and weight for long term reading. i alternate between the kindle paperwhite for reading in the daytime and at night sometimes and i use the kindle fire for reading in the evening and at night plus browsing the internet and getting email. this new kindle fire hd 2014 version is very fast and easy to use. setting it up for the internet and downloading my apps and books was a breeze. i like the fact that the larger memory allows me to carry more apps and books. the higher resolution of the screen is helpful in reading books as the text is clearer and easier on my eyes than the older kindle fires we own. the screen is better for playing apps and watching videos and movies and it is worth the upgrade from the older kindle fires.i like that this version has both a front and rear facing camera. i use the camera a lot on all of my tablets and i own many apple ipads, apple iphone and android tablets.read more fire hd 7 tablet nan amazon devices",5.0
378,14,"detailed review of the fire hd 7 - a great entry-level tablet at a great price! 1, the fire hd 7 is a great entry-level fire tablet that includes a 7 1200x800 216 ppi pixel density display. pixel density wise, this is the lowest off all the fire tablets but is still decent enough where you're going to get a nice picture on the display. it's by no means an ipad killer or galaxy tab killer and you really shouldn't purchase it for that purpose. this particular model is really tailored to reading kindle books, streaming video, browsing the web, checking email, and so forth. bottom line, it's a great deal at 139. i'm going to compare the features of the hd 7 with the features of the other fire tablets to help you make an informed decision on which model to go with:*** display ***the display is a 7 1200x800 resolution display with a 216 ppi pixel density which is not great, but not horrible either. it is the lowest pixel density of all the fire tablets with the fire hd 6 coming in at 252 ppi, the fire hdx coming in at 323 ppi, and the fire hdx 8.9 coming in at 339 ppi. the human eye really can't distinguish individual pixels beyond a density of about 300 ppi so you're not going to be getting a noticeably pixelated display by any means. all in all, this is a nice display.*** processor, gpu, and on-board storage ***the fire hd 7 comes with a respectable 1.5 ghz quad-core processor with enough power to run almost all of your content with ease, including smooth video playback. it comes with a mediocre 1 gb of ram which really is not sufficient in my opinion but it is what it is. this is not an ipad or galaxy tab killer by any means, but it gives you just enough power to use the essential amazon services you need.the hd 7 is substantially less powerful than the snapdragon 2.2 ghz and 2.read more fire hd 7 tablet nan amazon devices",5.0

437,14,"great value for 139 2, i'm writing this review with the benefit of being an experienced kindle fire user vs. someone brand new to the kindle family. in summary, for 139 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 500 or more you can spend on a wi-fi version of the ipad. overall, if you consider the price and the functionality i think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and last year's fire. if you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, i'd recommend this regular fire hd vs. a more expensive version. if you're comparing last year's hd model to this version and it is operating fine, i'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the fire to last year's fire hd but also some of the features for a first-time user.consistent with my experience with setup of previous models of the fire, setup took a while: despite being a brand new product, the fire attempted to download and install several operating software updates. you just need to be patient while it downloads and installs.screen display / video playback:this version of the fire has a great screen display and looking at the technical specs amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: i compared the viewing experience watching an episode of the lost ship. the display on this fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model.read more fire hd 7 tablet nan amazon devices",5.0

309,37,"updated review (after 2 months)... i am updating my review from two months ago.. my initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it. today i have been using the tap and sling daily for over the last two months and i felt like i needed to modify my review. i originally did not recommend this product, but after living with it, and growing to like it, i am changing my recommendation.the truth is, the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe. i have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling. i think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall. also, it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling.i initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock, but it isn't as big of a problem as i thought it would be. i just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it (leaving the top of the sling on). easy off and easy back on after.my only real lingering complaint would be the price. 20 for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive. i am increasing my stars by one. really the price is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me. i have come to really like the sling. i have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it. that has eased my concerns about keeping it clean/safe while throwing it into a work bag.my original is below. overall, i would (and have) recommended the sling to protect the tap.received the tap and the sling cover in the last 24 hours.read more amazon tap sling cover - magenta nan amazon devices",4.0

378,10,"detailed review of the kindle 10, as has been the case for years, amazon sloooowwwwly adds new changes and features to the kindle. this one is no exception. if you've used a kindle in the past, you're not going to notice much of a change with this one, but since there are some minor upgrades and so forth, i'll briefly go over them:*** screen ***the new kindle is touchscreen and has the typical matte finish with the slightly gray/off-white paper looking background. it's certainly not bright white, but it's also not lcd looking (dark gray.) it does not have buttons for page-turning as the older generations do. if you simply must have the page-turning buttons, please search for the older kindles that offer that. one last thing regarding the screen: this is not a kindle paperwhite or voyage where you have a back-lit screen... this has an unlit, off-white kindle screen. i will say, the text is noticeably crisper and bolder than i've seen with previous generation kindles and i believe that's because amazon is using e-ink's new carta displays instead of the previously used pearl displays. i love that and have been waiting for years for e-ink, the taiwan based company that makes the kindle screens for amazon, to improve them. it looks like they're finally getting it!the new kindle's screen resolution is 167 ppi which is slightly lower than the kindle paperwhite which is 212 ppi, and substantially lower than the kindle voyage which boasts an impressive 300 ppi (individual pixels at this density can not be distinguished by the naked eye.) price-wise though, the base model paperwhite runs 99 at the time of this review, and the voyage base model runs 199 so you can see, the more you pay, the better the resolution and features. 167 ppi is fine though...read more certified refurbished kindle e-reader nan amazon devices",5.0
551,10,"know what you are buying!!!! 16, i've had this kindle for a while now. many of the reviews say it all so i don't think i could add much. but i feel like i need to speak on behalf of this kindle to shield it from reviewers and owners who seem to have no idea what they bought. if this could help clear up any confusion for a first time buyer then writing this is worth it. so i have to begin by asking reviewers that confuse us alldo you have any clue what you bought let's all say it out loud: this kindle does not have a light!!!!!! it is an entry level model with no light. amazon has always sold non lighted kindles, and i still have many of them. they are a cheap way to get into the e-reader scene. can you read a real book in the dark of course not. so these non lighted kindles are not epic failures for not having a light just as the last novel you bought was not an epic failure for not having a built in light. it is ridiculous to buy this kindle then give it a 1 star review because it doesn't have a light. read the product descriptions. this kindle has no light, the paperwhite and voyage do.scream all to the heavens: this kindle does not have page turning buttons!!!! to buy this kindle then give it a 1 star review because your old kindle had page turning buttons and this one does not is insane. could you not see when you clicked on buy that this kindle had no page turning buttons. sometimes i think there are two kinds of kindle owners: those who want page turning buttons and those who don't mind moving their thumb a nano meter to turn a page. if you can tell by my sarcasm, i belong to the latter bunch.then of course there are the technically deficient that have no clue what wifi is, are unable to sign on, and blame it on the kindle. bam! another 1 star review.read more certified refurbished kindle e-reader nan amazon devices",5.0
437,10,"good value at 79 with a few nits 5, i am writing this from the perspective of being a long-time experienced kindle user vs. someone brand new. from an overall perspective, considering the pricing of the kindle with special offers at 79 vs. higher amounts for the different flavors of kindle available today, this one is a bargain. if you have wanted to get your kids a kindle to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because 119 to 400+ is a lot of money to risk with a child, maybe at 79 this is your price point.from a size standpoint, the reading screen is the exact same size as the other e-ink kindles. it is slightly thicker - but slightly lighter - than the kindle paperwhite, but to me it's not really a noticeable difference when you're holding it in a protective cover.opening up the box, included with the kindle is a micro-usb cord but no power adapter. that's really annoying. interestingly, and it seems rather chicken of amazon, a power adaptor has to be purchased separately for 15 if you purchase it at the same time as you purchase the kindle (or 20 if you purchase it later), so if you already have a micro-usb charger handy i wouldn't order one of the chargers.there are no page buttons - no buttons at all except for the power button - and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while you're reading, or swiping the screen with your finger.reading is easy on this one: in comparison to my kindle keyboard, the previous version of kindle, and a kindle dx the letters on the screen are much, much darker and easier to read: the display is crisp and dark.read more certified refurbished kindle e-reader nan amazon devices",4.0

514,42,"the best echo yet, especially if you have elderly parents this was really worth the wait. i bought the echo show for my parents, who are elderly, and have a variety of ailments. since they have arthritis, and a few other issues, i didn't want them to go and answer the doorbell, just to find it's someone soliciting them to buy random junk. so, last year, i bought and installed the ring doorbell pro in their house, which works very well. the ring doorbell pro is hardwired and not battery operated. after the skill was enabled, i could tell alexa to show me the front doorbell and a video feed automatically pops up. you really need a good wi-fi router with the echo show as the video will be jerky since the video is very high quality. if you have a good wi-fi router, the video comes up very quickly and runs very smooth. i thought the doorbell would launch the app on the echo show automatically, but it does not. you have to initiate the connection yourself. hopefully this will be an option in the next iteration of this skill. i can think of a whole bunch of ideas for this skill to do, but for a very first implementation, it works great with the hardwired version of the ring doorbell pro.the battery powered ring products do not work as great though. when trying to connect the echo show to a battery powered ring device, i get a message saying something like, the camera is asleep and needs to wake up and it could take 30 sec. this happens with my ring stickup camera. so, if you want the best experience, you should buy the ring doorbell pro instead of the battery powered versions.one of my parents just came out of the hospital and sometimes just doesn't have the energy to even pick up a cell phone when we call. so, we have another echo show, just for her, in drop in mode.read more echo show - black nan amazon devices",4.0

563,31,slowest fire sold i've owned several different tablets. this one is by far the slowest. and i don't mean it's a little slower. i mean you have to wait up to 2 minutes sometimes for the apps to load onto the screen. opening apps can be quick or take up to 3 minutes. i've had far more issues with this fire than any of the others we've owned. if i had realized the difference in speed i would have kept my old one. it's definitely not work the larger screen. it's a crap shoot on a daily basis on how fast it will be. but even on it's fastest day it's significantly slower than the others. certified refurbished fire hd 10 tablet nan amazon devices,3.0

736,31,fire ten ok have had this probably 3 weeks. wanted to be fair with my review. the battery in my kindle fire 8.9 hdx quit talking to the tablet so had to keep it plugged in to use it. tried the fire 8 first and just didn't care for how much smaller the screen was. returned the 8 waited a bit and ordered the fire 10. amazon did give me a discount due to my problem with the 8.9. the fire 10 in my opinion is no comparison to the 8.9. the apps with the 10 works more like smartphone apps. in the first three days it froze up 4 times. i wondered if it was doing this because i had too many apps opened. once i started closing the apps i wasn't using i haven't had the tablet freeze problem. i do like the bigger screen on the 10 and the colors are sharp and the pictures clear. i also learned that the 8.9 was no longer being supported by amazon and that meant no updates so eventually a replacement would have been necessary. why amazon stopped the 8.9 is beyond me but i'm doing ok now with the 10. if you get it give it some time. certified refurbished fire hd 10 tablet nan amazon devices,3.0

808,39,"almost like paperwhite v1 all over again 5, i've got mixed feelings on this one, unfortunately. this review is coming from a kindle enthusiast who has owned or used nearly every variation of the device since the 1st generation.size weight---it's noticeably smaller and lighter than the paperwhite. when i saw the specs it didn't really strike me as something that would make much difference to me, but in real life it's actually great. the voyage fits into a few of my coat pockets that the paperwhite was just a little too big to fit into.origami cover---i know there's a separate product page for the origami cover, but it's worth mentioning here as it is the official cover. the origami cover is ugly and i was skeptical, but i actually love it. it's weird because it opens by flipping over the top like a notepad. this actually makes it more comfortable to hold when the cover is open, in my opinion. it's hard to describe, but there are a lot more ways to hold the voyage when it's attached to this cover, and just generally is more comfortable to use. the origami part of the case works great as well... it stands vertically or horizontally (if you're laying down and reading, this is amazing).the other great new thing about this case is that the voyage attaches to it magnetically. it attaches and detaches very easily, unlike the paperwhite which seemed to be nearly permanently attached to the standard case. this is great because if you decide you want to read the device and appreciate how light/thin it is without a case attached, it's super easy to take it out.it's pricey but worth it.pagepress---one of the new features is pagepress, which has sensors on the outer edge of the device that you can squeeze to turn pages.read more kindle voyage e-reader nan amazon devices",3.0

351,29,"great update for those who use their kindle a lot! i'm a long time kindle user, and have upgraded a number of times. every upgrade was a significant improvement, and the oasis continues that trend. i love my voyage, but the oasis makes it feel like a hardback book. the pictures and descriptions don't do the size and weight justice. shockingly light, and small even with the case. used without the case, it's like holding a few sheets of paper. amazing. haven't had it long enough to evaluate the battery life, but never had a problem with the previous models, so i assume the promise of much longer battery life (with the secondary battery in the case) is accurate.the balance in the hand without the case is stunningly good. with the case feels a bit like the voyage (although quite a bit lighter than my voyage in its case). case is high quality and easy to put on and take off as needed. screen seems a smidge clearer and higher definition than my voyage (maybe due to the updated lighting system).i had the 'pressure sensitive' page turner option on my voyage turned off. much too jumpy and sensitive, even at its 'hard' setting. i won't miss that. the new mechanical buttons on the oasis are awesome. nice upgrade there, and nice to not have to touch the screen for the most part.yes, it is pricey. i would say if you are a 'few hour a week' reader, the paperwhite is your best bet (solid performance and very good price/value). but if you are a reading fanatic who reads a lot every day (like me!), the extra battery life and the balance/size/weight, along with the slightly improved screen is well worth the money, especially when spread over the life of the unit.edit: a few more comments now that i've been using the oasis for a number of months.read more kindle oasis with leather charging cover - black nan amazon devices",5.0

437,15,"quality tablet and excellent video / screen display 1, i'm writing this review with the benefit of being an experienced kindle fire user vs. someone brand new to the kindle family. in summary, you are getting a great deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 500 or more you can spend on a wi-fi version of ipad. overall, if you consider the price and the functionality i think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding. if you are a first-time large-screen tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration in comparison to more expensive versions, i'd recommend it. if you're comparing last year's hdx model to this version and it is operating fine, i'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the fire hdx to last year's fire hdx but also some of the features for a first-time user.consistent with my experience with setup of previous models of the fire, setup took a while: despite being a brand new product, the fire attempted to download and install several operating software updates. you just need to be patient while it downloads and installs.screen display / video playback:this version of the fire has the best screen display of any previous model of fire and looking at the technical specs amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp in a side-by-side comparison to last years hdx version and my ipad air (yes, the kindle guy uses an ipad for work): i compared the viewing experience watching an episode of the lost ship.read more fire hdx 8.9 tablet nan amazon devices",5.0
498,26,"ive loved both my paperwhite and voyage is the oasis worth the additional cost 2, update 7/24/16: after using my oasis for almost 3 months, i thought i would add a brief comment to my original review. i have settled on using the oasis for reading in bed, where it's lighter and easier to hold and i prefer the page turn button style. for my reading elsewhere, for example if i want to read while eating, i use my voyage w/origami case to hold it upright. i can read the same book using both kindles since they stay synch'd to one another, and it's given me basically the best of both worlds, at least for my style of reading. the voyage with cover almost seems clunky - bulkier and heavier - compared to the oasis, but when it's sitting on a table it hardly matters. i have to say that i'm fortunate in being able to afford both, and the new base model kindle that i recently picked up is not yet getting much use, even though much of my reading is in lighting conditions where the non-illuminated display works just fine. my original review follows.---------amazon released the first kindle in november of 2007. eight and a half years later, the oasis model is the 8th generation kindle and the third evolution of kindle with built-in illumination. the price of 300+ was a bit of a shock, but i ordered mine as soon as it was announced on april 13th. i then spent the next two weeks reading what was available online describing the features and benefits and asking myself whether or not i had made the right decision. now that its finally been released and i have it in my hands, how different is it, and is it worth what appears at first to be a very high price(my kindle experience: i purchased my first kindle (a first generation paperwhite), when it was first released in sept 2012. i purchased the voyage when it was first released, in sept 2014.read more kindle oasis e-reader with leather charging cover - walnut nan amazon devices",5.0
283,26,"a superb e-ink reader, but is it worth the money 1, okay, if you don't want to read my whole review, i'll summarize it right here: the oasis is the most technologically advanced e-ink reader that amazon - or anyone else, for that matter - has produced to date. but is it worth 290 for the least expensive version (wi-fi only with ads) in my opinion, the answer is no, not when the very capable paperwhite is available for 100 (at the time i'm writing this). but i'm sure that there is a market for the oasis, probably for the techno-geeks and gadgeteers like myself who love trying new products like the oasis, and serious readers who want the absolute best possible experience in reading. but for the typical reader, i just don't think the oasis adds enough to the reading experience to be worth the high price, especially for those who already have a paperwhite or voyage.for reference, here's a brief comparison of the oasis with the paperwhite and the voyage:oasis (2016)-----------------------------size: 5.6x4.8x0.13-0.33 (thickness varies)weight (wi-fi version): 4.6 ounces (without battery case)display: 6 diagonal, 300 pixels per inch, 16-level grayscale, led front-litstorage memory: 4gbpage turns: touchscreen plus page turn buttonsnumber of fonts: 9display lighting: manually adjustable front-lighting (10 leds)third generation paperwhite (2015)------------------------------size: 6.7x4.6x0.36weight (wi-fi version): 7.read more kindle oasis e-reader with leather charging cover - walnut nan amazon devices",5.0

399,26,"the best kindle ever... and i should know i've tried them all. i have owned literally (and i mean literally) every kindle since the first one. all the keyboard versions that followed the first one, the touch, the paperwhite, the voyage. all the fires since the first one, all the different sizes from 10 to 6 and every gen in between. (i know, i am a little crazy.) many of these are still in use among family members and my habit was to switch between fires depending on mood. my last attempt was an ipad mini, used only as an ereader, and for the first time in many years i bought books from somewhere other than amazon, because i found the ibooks experience so pleasant. bottom line... i was always seeking a kindle that fit all my needs as a book and nothing more. stop the press. i have found it.lets put a little context around this. i eventually migrated to the fires because although i liked the eink for reading, i also liked to see more detail on book covers and black and white didn't seem to offer that. the paperwhite and it's successors got closer, so that even without color the detail was sufficient to make browsing by cover satisfactory (something i have always done, even with real books).still though, what i didn't like about the eink versions was the inability to render a page without big gaps between words or even truncated lines when there was a big or hyphenated word in the line. i don't know whether it is just coincidence that i haven't seen that yet with the oasis, or whether the amazon ember font helps (i like this new font a lot) or whether it has been specifically addressed in the newer os. whatever, i have not seen that yet and it removes one of my reasons for preferring a tablet over an ereader.first impressions... not great.read more kindle oasis e-reader with leather charging cover - walnut nan amazon devices",5.0

274,3,"customer service--i'm stunned at how bad it was i purchase almost everything with the exception of food from amazon. i have been a prime member since the inception of the program. without exception, i have always received excellent customer service. until now. i'm having difficulty with my fire tv connecting to my wifi. last saturday i spent approximately 1- hours (maybe 2) troubleshooting with two women techs on the phone. mary (who i was passed to from the first tech because of her expertise) said she thought it wasn't just a problem unique to me and asked me if she could call me back on sunday after researching the problem. i had no problem with that. no call on sunday so i called on monday. much to my surprise, there was no record of my call attached to my file. the rep was confused as to whether i was talking about fire wire or fire tv so i was first sent to a different department. finally, i got through that fire wire was not the same as fire tv and i was transferred back to digital. we went through the same troubleshooting taking up a lot of my time. i was willing to do it until we were going around in circles and my phone was running out of juice. the gentleman asked me if he could research and call me later in the day. no call. it's tuesday--still no call.it really pains me to have to say anything negative about amazon's customer service as it has never been less than excellent in the past. i've noticed i haven't gotten a survey as i usually do after a customer service call. whoever amazon has farmed out their digital customer service to will ruin their excellent customer service reputation and they will lose sales because of it. i'm going to wager a bet that there is no record of the 3-4 hours of my time on the phone trying to solve a problem and no record of two promises to call me back. i would have had more respect for these reps if i had received a call saying they were sorry, but they weren't able to come up with a solution for me.i'm hoping amazon has kept a record of my past reviews and will review my account and see just how much i've spent over the years as a loyal customer. i'm very disappointed that i had to write this review, and i'm hoping someone who can change things reads this and saves amazon's reputation. i can't be the only one receiving this kind of treatment. it's obvious that the people who are techs for fire tv are not the same techs that i've dealt with in the past. in fact, i don't think they are even in the same country. what a pity. amazon fire tv amazon categories,amazon devices,electronics features,streaming media players,consumer electronics,see more amazon fire tv digital hd media streamer (late...",1.0

this video idcvmootyxbamrif04preplayimageid //a length:: 0:45 minsnote on video:i've made this to illustrate the current works of fire tv's voice search feature. it appears to be limited to amazon content, at least for videos. i believe that they do include a third party service if you search for music.i am searching for house of cards, season 2, a netflix original. i am a netflix subscriber so i would expect the netflix listing to be displayed but fire tv only returns the show's season 1 available for purchase at amazon and does does not list netflix at all. as a netflix subscriber, i could watch both seasons 1 and 2 for free but, according to fire tv's search, season 2 doesn't exist and i'd have to pay 2.99 per episode if i wanted to watch season 1.see how roku's search (second half of video) correctly shows that season 1 is available from netflix, amazon, mgo and vudu and that i can gety get season 2 from netflix. it's also telling me (checkmarks) that i subscribe to 3 of the 4 services listed.it's up to everyone to weigh amazon's faster and more convenient voice search feature that returns amazon-only content vs. roku's ability to find content across the channels/services it carries.review begins here:as a current/former owner and user of streamers such as roku 3, roku stick and google's chromecast and also streaming/gaming platforms such as ps3/ps4 and xbox 360/one, i believe i can do a fair assessment on what amazon's fire streamer is about and how it compares with the alternatives. i rely on reviews to help me make informed and rational purchase decisions and, hopefully, my assessment of amazon's fire tv may help others decide whether this is what they need or want.broad assessmentthe fire tv will have to find its place in a pretty crowded marketplace. from what i've experienced so far, due to its tight integration with the fire hdx tablets and amazon's own instant video service in search it should be a great pick for anyone who owns the amazon tablet and already subscribes to amazon's prime. its ability to play games and the ease of downloading them should also appeal to non-hard-core gamers. for everybody else, depending on one's specific needs and expectations, the fire tv may or may not be the 'right' streamer to buy.as one who purchased amazon's original kindle fire on day one and went through several generations of amazon's kindle reader i expect that amazon's streamer will also evolve or grow overtime. amazon will listen to 'us' and the next generation streamer will be a much more interesting, 'new and improved', more capable and better tuned to our needs and wants. until then, i would say that the current fire tv is a competent, amazon-content-biased (through search) streamer with gaming capabilities, lacking some in content and showing some innovation on search (offset by its currently favoring amazon's service) and the user interface in general. parental controls and the games could make it a favorite streamer if young children are also watching. if all you want is streaming and don't care about casual gaming you may feel that you are paying for capabilities that you don't need.contentthe fire tv offers most but not all mainstream services and i suspect it covers what most of us will ever want to access and i am sure that more services will be added in time. however, at this time amazon's selection pales when compared to roku's 1000+ wildly diverse channels but the rokus have been around for a while. all mainstream services now on fire tv are also available on roku, ps3/4, xbox 360/one and many on google's chromecast.fire tv attempts to be a little different when it comes to accessing content, allowing for voice search but results are currently returned mostly from amazon's instant video. by comparison, rokus offer text based cross-service search with results returned from most 'big' providers. amazon's attempt to predict and preload what we are most likely to watch will have to be assessed over a longer period of time so, time will tell.the soon to be implemented parental controls should differentiate and distinguish amazon's product from the competition once they are implemented.innovationamazon's great innovative, revolutionary, disruptive device was the kindle reader and the enhanced kindle paperwhite. i suspect that thousands of acres of trees are still known as 'forests' instead of 'recyclable material' these days because of the kindle. amazon's fire tablets are nice but they are... tablets. the fire tv streamer/gaming device falls probably under 'okay' or 'interesting' streamers and 'not too bad' gaming platforms.the quad-core cpu is also nice but, whether i'm streaming on a significantly more powerful ps4 or a tiny one-core cpu chromecast, the video/audio quality seems to be comparable and practically indistinguishable. i assume that the reason for a more powerful cpu is the game-playing part.the lack of large permanent storage (hdd) implies that, as a gaming platform, the fire tv will allow for mostly small to medium-size games with a lot of cloud interaction and storage. again, a feature that may not be suitable for those whose isps charge by the megabyte or impose a monthly download quota on their customers.game playing on the fire tv works but those used with big console's lag-free controllers that 'rumble', talk back and sense motion may not view the fire tv as a serious gaming platform.i would say that amazon's streamer is solidly in the mainstream as far as innovation. it's a quality product but not a revolutionary one and that's still okay.valuethere's very little that amazon's fire tv does that other platforms don't do.- the ps3/4 and the xbox 360/one are vastly superior gaming platforms and equally good streamers and multimedia machines. only they are much larger physically and cost significantly more.- the chromecast and the rokus are a lot more innovative and allow for a lot more flexibility and integrate nicely with tablets and pcs and allow for streaming personal content without being limited to a specific brand or model of tablet. they are also somewhat more difficult to setup.- small streamers such as the roku stick and the chromecast are very portable as they fit into one's shirt pocket. amazon's fire tv could be carried around at least in theory but it's not as easy to move around.- roku is still the leader of 'content' but amazon's selection should cover what most of us want to watch most of the time.- the fire tv costs a lot more than a roku or a chromecast but, even if a gaming controller is added, is still less than a ps3 or an xbox 360- voice search as implemented on fire tv at the time i am writing this (restricted to amazon and vevo) is in effect hiding content from other services, potentially costing you money if one show is available to purchase or rent at amazon but it may be also carried by another service you subscribe to as a 'free' stream.who needs itanyone who already has one or more roku, chromecast or xbox, playstation in their homes probably don't need one at this time. unless they are tightly integrated into amazon's ecosystem or are cable cutters who wish some tighter controls over what their kids are watching.those who are looking for their first streamer should consider- fire tv's ease of use (beats the chromecast but it's probably on par with roku and the xbox/playstations)- amazon's great user support- roku's enormous channels selection- playstation and xbox being clearly superior gaming platforms (if you don't mind paying up to 60 for newly released games)- amazon's attempt to keep their users confined to amazon's own hardware platforms and content streams vs. roku's and chromecast relative openness- fire tv's split gaming/streaming personality (jack of 2 trades) vs. roku's and chromecast focus on streaming- price, of courseit's not an easy decision to make. i would be very happy with the fire tv if it was the first streamer device in the house. with so many stream-capable and game-playing boxes/sticks already operating and doing well, i like amazon's fire tv for being a well designed, capable streamer with some nice extra capabilities but i also like and i've been using the rokus for their huge number of channels and portability and great interface and the chromecast for allowing me to easily send whatever is in my chrome browser to the tv. i hope that amazon's search will soon expand to cover non-amazon services or it won't be a useful tool. i may not have the the fire tv attached to the big tv in the living room but our daughter who happens to be a faithful kindle and amazon prime user asked for it in her room. amazon fire tv amazon categories,amazon devices,electronics

513,3,"fantastic right out of the box the fire tv came well packaged with extremely simple instructions. plug in the power cable and hdmi cable (not included), put batteries in the remote and that's it. after initial start up there is an update that must be run, but after a few minutes the unit was up and running. interface is nice looking and easy to use. voice search worked perfectly...it understood this kentucky accent instantly. flipping through the movie choices is super fast (almost too fast since it has skipped a movie a time or two). netflix is on the home page, but you have to install the app before using it the first time. as i'm typing this review the unit is displaying some beautiful screensaver pictures while i have a movie paused. if you store your photos on amazon's cloud you can use your own pictures instead. picture quality is fantastic and movies start up lightning fast. the only thing i see as a con would be how the prime movies are marked. the placement of the prime marker in the upper left of the movie icon is very small and isn't as prominent as it should be making it rather difficult to tell whether it's prime or a movie you would rent/purchase. i figure in the days and weeks ahead amazon will be listening to customer suggestions (as they usually do) and more and more updates will be forthcoming making this device even better. for me the amazon fire tv is a winner. it will definitely be replacing a directv receiver i was using.update: after one full day of using amazon's fire tv i am more than satisfied with my purchase.if you read reviews like i do make sure to skip over the ones that don't have the amazon verified purchase listed under their name or click that their post is unhelpful. these are people who are trying to review a product without even having it in their possession. if you discount those reviews (which make the overall rating less than it should be) you will discover that the majority of people who actually purchased this product are very satisfied.4-6-14 update: added the amazonbasics digital optical audio toslink cable and this has added a whole new dimension to the sound quality of my tv. the sounds are more richer and louder than ever before. i am continually amazed at what this little device is capable of. i really suggest getting the cable i mentioned above to make your fire tv experience even better4-8-14 update: turned on the device today and went to start up netflix...all i got was a white screen. turned the unit off and on, but still a white screen. i uninstalled the netflix app and reinstalled and it worked again. i don't believe it was a problem on the device itself, but rather the app since all of the other apps worked fine.4-15-14 update: had the same white screen issue with netflix some more. contacted customer service and reported the issue. he stepped me through the process of going into the settings then the apps. when you come to netflix instead of uninstalling click on force stop. this fixed the issue. if i have the problem again he asked that i contact them back immediately so that they can contact the developers with the issue. i continue to enjoy this device and have since gotten rid of the directv receiver i had connected. i can't recommend the fire tv enough6-25-14 update: my fire tv is still going strong and i am completely happy with it. i have found that i watch tv more so on the fire than my directv. the one thing i haven't checked (but will sometime) is the usb port. i've got to save some movies to my flash drive and see if i can play a saved movie from the drive using the usb port on the fire. finding amazon content is a breeze using the voice search and searching through movies or videos using netflix and others is fine. yes, it would be great to be able to use the voice search with everything else, but it's not a deal breaker for me nor an inconvenience. i would imagine amazon will eventually include their voice search on any third party application as time allows. even after using it all this time i'm still amazed at the sound and picture quality of such a tiny device. for me amazon just gets better and better.8-4-14 update: i had movies saved to an external hard drive and i plugged it into the usb port on the amazon fire, unfortunately, it doesn't work. it basically did nothing. it made no noise like it was trying to access my hard drive nor did it recognize any usb plugged in. hopefully amazon will push out an update to fix this at some point and time. it would be a wonderful feature to have.

418,3,"superior amazon customer service support was the deciding factor for me.... here goes, i'm the 9 thousandth reviewer for this product lol. short preface: i love amazon, so when comparing all streaming devices in the end i went with the fire tv because of the outstanding customer service, and it will improve with time. that being said, i share the frustrations that all my fellow buyers have: i hate not being able to sort out the non prime videos, i truly dislike paying for an episode (i didn't see that one coming, even though i did a ton of research). but overall i love my new cable bill, which only includes internet and basic, and i mean basic, service (15.00) because i'm reserving the right to order hbo and showtime at some point. was massively disappointed in hulu plus, because they don't offer the entire series in a show anymore (did they run out of server space or what) netflix was a pleasant surprise. in case you are wondering, netflix, hulu plus, and prime are your alternatives to paying your cable bill. and streaming is quite alright...after you get over the initial shock of not having live tv, although, abc does do live tv hope the other stations follow suit soon. overall, as a non tech person, it was ridiculously easy to hook this up, really anyone can do it. and like i said, if you're comparing other products, in the end amazon cannot be beat for customer service or support. amazon fire tv amazon categories,amazon devices,electronics features,streaming media players,consumer electronics,see more amazon fire tv digital hd media streamer (late...",4.0

257,3,"works great with one critical flaw. (significantly improved) having received my fire tv today, i've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.setup was a no brainer. it required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.the image quality (movies and games) is excellent. i've tried several movies from amazon prime and they look and sound nearly blu ray quality as far as i can tell.navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.the remote works very well. i haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when i have tried it, it worked well. the buttons on the remote are well thought out and i prefer it to the apple tv remote.i only have one gripe. as far as i can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for amazon prime members. this makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. there are some categories that are limited to prime (most popular on prime, for kids on prime) i want to be able to just see what's available for prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for prime. i'm sure this isn't an oversight. i suspect amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. a workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.perhaps i just haven't found the way to search for prime available content. i hope that's the case or i will really be disappointed.update 7/21/2014:the latest software upgrade as significantly improved the device for amazon prime members - addressing most of my original complaints.now that there is an entire section dedicated to prime content, it is much easier to find things without having to wade through pay to view content. i wouldn't mind seeing more 'categories' to search through, but don't want to diminish the improvement.it's still not possible to search and return only prime content. i think it should be possible to tell the device (when you search) that you only want returns from what is available for free to prime members.the new 'music' option looks intriguing but seems to have no purpose at this point. not sure why it was added, but i hope it grows into a useful feature given the new prime music package.i would also like to see some sort of dlna feature added. as one who rips all content that i buy (blu rays, dvds, cds) to a computer on my network, i would very much like to be able to stream this material to the firetv. adding support for a connected usb device is not a solution for me. i have no intention of keeping two copies of all this material. read more amazon fire tv amazon categories,amazon devices,electronics features,streaming media players,consumer electronics,see more amazon fire tv digital hd media streamer (late...",4.0

98,3,"great device with some issues, but overall great device. first i would like to say that i am coming from using google tv. fire tv is a great device. the voice search is accurate at picking up what i say. my biggest problem with this device is also with the voice search. coming from google tv if you used the search feature if would look for it in more places. lets say i am searching for the movie gremlins. on google tv it would look for it in netflix, amazon instant, instant prime, google play store, hbo go, and you get the idea. this device for example will not check netflix. so i must do a voice search to see if it is on amazon, if not i must open lets say netflix and use the up, down, left, right buttons and manually enter the letter to find out if it is on netflix. that was the big issue for me. a small issue is the amount of apps. no hbo go, google play store, and others. i am not blaming amazon for this. it is an open system so hbo and others just need to make the apps for it. this devise is quick, and amazon items start up instantly, but not netflix. netflix must load first, but that is not a big deal. if you are wondering why i am switching from google tv, it is because google neglected it and it hasn't received updates in a long time. i think google gave up on it. amazon fire tv amazon categories,amazon devices,electronics features,streaming media players,consumer electronics,see more amazon fire tv digital hd media streamer (late...",4.0
638,3,"i'd love to see amazon take a netflix model for a ... i own a roku and apple tv and have to say that the amazon fire tv falls into more of the apple tv category. it's definitely a walled garden of content that feeds you into amazon's prime tv offerings. you can access a lot of titles there for pay and often less expensively than on demand options available from your cable provider.however, for your prime investment, there are no free titles. i'd love to see amazon take a netflix model for a certain number of older titles. the price barrier keeps me from watching older titles, but the prices of latest releases are about average and worth it.the interface is great. i find the voice activation to be really accurate and easy to use. it's really how you are meant to navigate the massive number of options available.performance is best in class as the fire tv has a quad core processor that is unmatched by any other provider. i'd love to see a great game title arrive on the box that would make the game controller worth the investment. however, for an all-in-one, solution the game selection can definitely hit the spot.i use the plex and netflix apps available for this device and they perform great. certainly, there's no blu-ray player that can match the capability of this device.all-in-all i definitely recommend this device to anyone, but still prefer the roku since roku isn't selling its own content service, so it agnostically serves a lot of free content that you didn't even know existed. amazon fire tv amazon categories,amazon devices,electronics features,streaming media players,consumer electronics,see more amazon fire tv digital hd media streamer (late...",5.0

673,3,"this box is a game changer for on demand content amazon knocked it out of the park. refreshed updated with tips i am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, apple tv, wdtv, htpc, chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):first is apple tv which is easy to use (interface) but apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no prime streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. the reason for selecting apple tv is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like amazon's content).the second option you could consider was roku--which really means a roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. now roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the roku 3. it is for that reason you will see me address the roku 3 so often in this review.i have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.wdtv: are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.chromecast: is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via chrome's browser not at the same quality level. this does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than firetv/roku/apple tv. but if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.smart tvs: most of these are fine for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes. normally you pay 150-400+ extra for features that are found in these 100 boxes. i have not found a smart tv that is decent and is also a good value for what you are getting. the advantage is that you can use your tv remote to access the content. (and that is about it)htpc: these are desktop computers or mac minis or android sticks that you load software on to stream video to your tv. these can add content that no normal streaming box can access, without giving up quality but they are only recommended for something comfortable with technology that doesn't mind fixing the issues that come up from time to time.video game consoles: xbox/playstations can access some of the content that streaming boxes do and have plenty of power to deliver the streams. the downside is the cost (unless you already have one) and the interfaces. these consoles are not designed to stream video exclusively so the interfaces are decent but can be clunky.(you can use other options but frankly they aren't worth the hassle for the amount of hair pulling you would do.)now this amazon product has changed everything. it might not be the box for you...but honestly there is a good chance that it should be. this is a brand new category for amazon and they got a lot right, but there are a few shortcomings (at least at launch) as well so read all of this to see what those are.amazon's fire tv boxpros:+ nothing else is this fast. while roku 3 impressed the world, this raises the bar dramatically. with a quad core processor and 4 times the memory of any other streaming product, it speeds through menus, boots quicker, starts videos quicker and honestly has the muscle to not struggle with higher end resolutions and surround sound like other boxes can do at times. the best way i can explain it, you will have extra hours at the end of the year because this box is that much faster.+ voice search is amazing. it really works. less using a four directional keypad to enter in titles is a real time saver and makes you wonder why this wasn't done before but it is only for amazon content and vevo (music videos) (at least for now). you can not use the voice search with netflix for example.+ ready for gaming, well at least once you spend another 40. the 40 gaming controller feels a bit pricy for this type of gaming and really should be 25 or less in my opinion. that being said, this box has real games you would actually want to play instead of a very limited selection on roku 3 but it is not a real console at 100 and honestly shouldn't be compared to them.+ better image quality i know you are thinking i am imagining things or have changed my setup but both myself and my wife have noticed that generally (in different apps) the video is slightly sharper and clearer. we are using the exact same tv, settings, even the same hdmi cable that we used with the roku 3 until we switched it for the fire tv box. we have noticed that especially on poor quality feeds that the image quality is noticeably better than under the same feeds with roku 3. now i don't know if there is better graphic chips or if the bigger processor can do more tweaking while streaming but it seems to be something. as image quality is a huge deal for most folks (and normally us streamers have to suffer with decent quality) this is certainly worth noting. so far we have noticed this under netflix, vevo and plex.cons:- it lacks soul. yes, soul. the fire tv box and remote are built like a dvd player or appliance--cold, fast, efficient. unlike roku 3 where the box seems to have a bit of the personally of tivo--it feels warmer, more inviting. everything about this box is business like, including the interface and the lack of options to change it.- the interface is more than merely cold. it is simply less flashy/pretty than the roku 3 interface. while fast, i am less tempted to wander around like i do on roku 3. it seems like they are being pretty dependent on the voice search function which is great but it leaves you missing out on the random items you find along the way with the roku 3 interface. i will update this more upon extended use.- the voice search only works for amazon's own content (and vevo) and not most 3rd party channels like netflix.- the remote is not ready for gaming use, compared to the roku 3 remote with gaming buttons when you turn the remote sideways and more sensors for detecting movements/motion.- another feature about the remote i don't care for is the use of bluetooth instead of wifi. roku used to use bluetooth on their former high end box but instead replaced it with wifi to increase battery life and to add the headphone jack in the remote. it will likely take a few weeks of use to report battery life but this has me concerned.- no headphone jack function like roku 3. now to be honest, if you use that on the roku 3 it can be a battery drain but it is a cool feature.- missing some popular channels at launch. there is no hbo-go, no m-go and no vudu. in addition, the channel count is much less than roku's at launch.- channels operate differently on firetv than the do on roku 3. see my notes below for more information.overall:this fire tv box took so much from other company's products with only a few missing items. they focused on delivering smooth, fast performance with less frills than roku 3 for the same price. while there are missing channels and features, the biggest failure for me personally is the cost of the gaming controller. without it, this box isn't ready for gaming but adding 40 more for the ability to try out the functionality seems pretty steep. had amazon included it with every fire tv box, they would have sold a lot more games and had everyone calling the roku 3 a poor value.if you do not have any streaming box yet, i would highly recommend this box over every other product on the market right now. i don't make this endorsement lightly. i currently own 3 roku 3 boxes because i liked them so much, until i used this fire tv box. this box means roku will have to really work on improving their product for roku 4 or they will lose the high end market. (an update, my wife officially asked to replace the roku 3 boxes with more fire tv boxes tonight. yes, these things are that good folks)if you have a roku 3 box, really look at the missing channels and features--are they something you could give up for faster performance (also look at my notes on the features of the various common apps.) if the answer is yes, then grab one of these and try it. if no, wait to see if amazon adds features/channels. at the very least, consider an fire tv box for your next box.i do not personally recommend apple tv as they are still too slow and lack too many features and functions. apple keeps promising something amazing but delivering minor improvements.if you are on a budget and have an android based tablet, consider chromecast. it is a good value for the price but you do give up features and content to save on the cost compared to roku 3 fire tv.i am giving this box a 4.8 rating, compared to a 4.2 for roku 3.i will update this review regularly for a while, so check back for more information also if you have questions or comments, please feel free to ask them in the comments section. either myself or other helpful people will do our best to respond to them.update 1:based on comments, i wanted to add a few points.regarding comments that i received the item free or are paid by amazon to write this review, etc.i paid the full list price and local sales tax for this box (grrr). nothing was provided to me nor was i paid anything to write about this device. i do not work for amazon, i own my own company. for this item, i am just a customer. in fact, i didn't expect to even purchase a fire tv prior to it being announced because i figured it would only deal with amazon's own content which i feel is much weaker than netflix. in fact, i have talked two different family members into getting netflix over amazon's prime streaming service in the past month alone.hbo go:this has been repeated over and over in the comments but hbo go support for me is not something i am interested in as i do not have cable service anymore nor do i feel that hbo is a better value than netflix. i would not go without netflix support at all but i personally think hbo go is more niche for many people and honestly i bet this device will get that channel before too long. clearly the hbo go people seem to be pushing the issue but i know 11 streaming box users and none use hbo go so while i noted the missing feature above, people still seem to want to beat me up over it.update 2:channels:it needs to be said that some channels require cable/satellite subscriptions (to those channels) like hbo go (not currently on this box), showtime, espn, etc. even if you have hbo, it does not mean that your provider allows the hbo go, so look into that before purchasing any box with that in mind. i do like the bloomberg tv (not available on roku 3) app which actually features a live tv feature.netflix app: is the older style with the tall covers (like vhs boxes) instead of the new netflix interface that uses short wide covers (like on roku 3). netflix has said they are moving everything to the new software but the fire tv box doesn't have it yet. that makes comparing performance harder from roku 3 to fire tv. on my isp provider comcast (netflix recently agreed to pay comcast so they have faster streams to customers) i do not see a huge improvement in performance in buffing like you see on other channels. what it does seem to do is start in better quality and/or speed the improvement in quality. my guess is that the netflix app needs to be tweaked to maximize the performance of this hardware. one positive with the firetv app is that it plays the entire tv episode before switching to a small window with the countdown starting for the next episode. i can't tell you how many times i had to click, click, click and click just to see the end of an episode under roku 3.also, the firetv netflix app has two features that were removed from the updated roku app. before going into a tv show, firetv tells you how many total episodes that netflix has. on the roku it shows you the number of seasons instead. i personally prefer the number of episodes but clearly that is a personal preference. another point worth mentioning is that the firetv netflix app shows you how many items you have in your list and what item number you are on. that information is missing from the roku 3 netflix app.amazon prime content: does not loop--a feature they should add (and likely will). this means once you get to the end, it just stops instead of keeping going.voice search:voice search does cover some 3rd party content, despite everyone reporting it works on amazon's content only. i have repeated confirmed it supports the vevo app and will find music videos in that app. that may mean that other 3rd party apps are covered as well, or certainly might be able to be in the future. if you search for something that has prime content and vevo content, it will default to the option with the most options. to switch to the other, simply arrow up and either left or right to see the music videos or prime search results.optical out:i noticed this box featured an optical out port but normally run everything through my lg tv (via hdmi) and then use an optical out to my receiver (so i never have to change the receiver's settings) so i wasn't excited about this addition to the fire tv box over my roku 3 boxes. i stand corrected. i decided to run my audio via the optical cable into the receiver directly from this fire tv box (something that i can not do with roku 3) and it fixed all random lip-sync issues i have from time to time on the roku 3 box (and the same with the hdmi output on this box).now i know this is not a typical setup for many people but i do know that tons of people have lip-sync issues with hdmi connections so being able to bypass the hdmi minefield is much more important than i expected.vevo app:this app works better than the roku 3 app performance wise...one quick example is that some content simply fails on the roku 3 app--try watching britney spears's work b**ch (don't make fun of me). vevo can play this video fine on youtube and on the fire tv app but struggles on roku 3's app. some of vevo's content is also available via voice search too.remote:i do miss the jump back button on the remote that roku 3 features. it is a tiny thing but it once you are used to jumping back to see that painting in the background or catch that line that you didn't hear because the phone rang, or someone was talking, you feel lost without it. update they did include this feature but hid it abit. you simply double click the reward button to skip back. i haven't seen anyone else mention this tip so you saw it here first peoplei do like that the enter button is back in the center of the directional keys. this is the way it used to be on roku boxes before someone at roku decided to move it below the directional keys, so you have to move your thumb oddly to press it.multitasking:what multitasking you ask since you haven't seen this advertised or mentioned elsewhere, i can understand your confusion but try this: load a pandora stream...then click on the home button and browse for movies/tv you want to watch. as long as you are in the home/amazon prime content, you can browse while pandora continues playing. now pandora dies when you enter another app like netflix but it shows you that multitasking is built into the operating system and may be utilized in future features. (again, this tip is only found here)another update: this tip also works when browsing plex content before you play something. so even when utilizing a 3rd party app, it can keep going. when it changes to a new song, a small window pops up on the lower right hand side of the screen to tell you know the new song title and artist.plex app:compared to the roku app, plex for firetv is totally different. there are some cool features, like the backgrounds, the screensaver using your photos and the much faster menuing (night and day from roku 3) but i do miss the channels not requiring a couple clicks to switch to online to see. i do miss that clicking the play button doesn't play a clip, instead you select it (click) and then play it (second click).screensaver:firetv has a screensaver that is honestly pretty cool in my opinion. i am not saying you can't do this with other boxes but no other box comes set up to display random photos (and includes a decent amount of beautiful photos as well.) this functionality covers 3rd party apps like netflix and plex too so you have a seamless slideshow no matter what you are using when it starts. this is the sort of thing you see on pcs not streaming boxes and it is a nice touch.game changing:many commenters have argued that this device is not gaming changing and many have rating my review not helpful because of that title.i said nothing else is this fast to which one commenter said, nobody cares how fast an streaming box is. that's not a game changeractually using it you will see what i mean. this is the first time a company has put so much into creating a very solidly made hardware device. like a fast computer (which this basically is), it will depend on software that is written for it to fully show off its abilities.when amd created their first processor that competed directly with intel's higher end processors, it was a game changer, correct, because it changed the landscape of personal computers forever, lowered pricing, etc.people will look back in 5 years at this moment and say amazon's firetv changed how consumer streaming video boxes were made (instead of barely enough processing power to stream, they became able to compete with htpcs and mac minis). this is the beginning of a new generation of streaming boxes.i said voice search is amazing. and they said not unique, by any means. my xbox, ps3, tablets, all have this, and all work amazingly.find one person who owns this that doesn't say this voice search works better than anything from google, apple or microsoft. the fact that little old amazon could out deliver those tech giants is shocking. the fact this works via a tiny remote makes it very easy to get use to. there is no other product in this price range that does this and no other streaming box even offers it at any cost.i said ready for gaming, well at least once you spend another 40 to which they said: and stick to basic android games. no thanks. i have a real console (or a couple of them) that can play real games...this isn't meant to compete with more expensive game consoles. it is meant to bring gaming to streaming boxes, just like tablets/cellphones have brought gaming to millions. they have not replaced gaming consoles (and likely never will) just like this box will not have you ditch your gaming console either but instead it opens you up to tons of games you can't play on that same console. just imagine all the cheap under 5/free games you can enjoy on your firetv box. as i said above in my main review, i think amazon really should have thrown in the controller to really get peopling playing the games but i can understand why they needed to limit their losses.again, this is a best in class hardware device with real gaming and the best voice search on any tech device (and the only one for a streaming video box). every future streaming box will be measured against this one. tell me how that isn't game changingplease understand that everyone has different priorities and requirements so no one box is going to be perfect for everyone. i am attempting to do my best to address most of the many options and provide a decently balanced opinion of them.hopefully this review has been helpful to you. if so, please let me know by clicking the button below. remember you don't have to agree with everything i said to think it was helpful ) read more amazon fire tv amazon categories,amazon devices,electronics features,streaming media players,consumer electronics,see more amazon fire tv digital hd media streamer (late...",5.0
245,3,"no way to search or browse prime movies only fail i was really looking forward to using what was hyped as an amazing piece of entertainment equipment, but the actual experience falls short.pros:+ user interface and underlying hardware is fast+ form factor of the device and remote control is very sleek+ plays games fairly well, especially for such a small box+ quality of amazon videos is very good+ voice search works quite well+ the device came pre-configured for my amazon account. i just plugged it in, updated the software, and away i wentcons:- first and foremost, there is still no way to search for only free movies on prime.- amazon touts it's 40,000 prime movies available, but good luck finding them. there is no categorization by genre. you are stuck surfing through dumb lists of movies, or using the search function, which almost never returns any prime movies- voice search works only on amazon content. you cannot use this to search within netflix, for example- the amazon firetv box only comes with 8gb of memory for game and app storage, which is completely inadequate. there are games available for download that consume almost 2gb for one game. good luck downloading a 1.76gb game, like the racing game featured in the list of top games.clearly, amazon is marketing this device as a way to push its video content. in the help video that automatically plays the first time you use the device, it even offers you a 30 day prime membership for free to try it out. however, amazon has no incentive to help you actually search for and find this free content. it's clearly evident in the lack of ability to filter search results on free prime content only. this is my biggest beef with amazon, by far. i want a netflix-like experience, where my prime content is sorted by genre, and i can search for free movies only. now, if you want to pay for video rentals, by all means buy this device, because it works really well. if you want it to access your prime content only, stick to the roku box you probably already have, because it works just as good.update:i called customer service, and talked to a guy about how i can search for and access my 40,000 prime movies. well....you can't according to him, i can only find the prime movies on the two lists on firetv that say recently added to prime and top prime movies. those lists are 73 items, and 150 items, respectively. there is no way to search or browse free prime content only. the guy i talked to said this was a very common request for people. of course it is. i don't want to pay for video rentals if i just paid for a prime membership to access free content. amazon completely failed. i am returning the fire tv. amazon fire tv amazon categories,amazon devices,electronics features,streaming media players,consumer electronics,see more amazon fire tv digital hd media streamer (late...",1.0

715,3,"fire tv (apple tv + chromecast) in addition to the fire tv, i have an apple tv as well as a chromecast. by far and large, the best product is the fire tv. i use it more than both the other ones combined. having integration between my prime list and the device is clutch, as i consume media across several different devices.i do wish i could search by prime instant, so i hope they will fix that. i also wish i could cast a prime instant streaming video from a device to the fire tv, but i don't see that as an option (although i can cast youtube to my fire tv, which is really cool).there is no doubt that it is faster than both apple tv and chromecast, and the voice recognition is so convenient. i also have the game controller, and the games are pretty good. i don't game much, but i wanted to check it out. i was surprised at the speed of the games and the level of engagement.i'd also like to be able to see a future improvement where screens can be mirrored from devices to this (both chromecast and apple tv have this). from an educator's standpoint, this could be the 100 solution to wireless projection for classroom teachers (apple tv doesn't play well with enterprise level security, and chromecast doesn't do well with some software that is essential for instruction).all in all, it's my favorite media device. it's faster, has a great and snappy ui, and is easy to setup. amazon fire tv amazon categories,amazon devices,electronics features,streaming media players,consumer electronics,see more amazon fire tv digital hd media streamer (late...",5.0

114,3,"finally...the right streaming device this is a wonderful streaming device. i have been an apple tv man since 2008, but i have decided that i just might never return to my apple tv. i have used/owned all 3 generations and have known them inside and out (unlocked my 1st generation for secret stuff. shhhh) and swore by them for years. i just received my amazon fire tv device this afternoon and plugged it up without a hitch. voice command is a nice touch, but i was most impressed with the speed of the quad core processor. no more waiting for my videos to buffer, and this is especially important in my house where my wife, kids, and i are sometimes simultaneously streaming videos. final word: if you're just looking for a great device to stream both netflix and amazon prime, then you've found the right streamer. amazon fire tv amazon categories,amazon devices,electronics features,streaming media players,consumer electronics,see more amazon fire tv digital hd media streamer (late...",5.0
253,3,"i love my fire tv i got mine from an electronics store, because i didn't want to wait for it to arrive in the mail. setup was a breeze. i don't have cable, so prior to this, i had to hook my laptop up to my tv to enjoy prime and netflix content on it. i'm also really pleased that they added a youtube app that was the number one drawback for me when considering this device. from what i've read, i figured i'd sideload one, but they saved me the trouble.once i signed in to youtube and linked my mobile devices, i even gained the ability to send content to my tv for viewing i don't have a fire phone or kindle (although i do have a paperwhite), so i'm not able to comment on the connectivity with those.i can't say enough good things about this tiny box. i've had it for a couple of months and use it every day the user interface is intuitive and efficient. i really love the screen saver pictures, too. most of them are breathtaking, and they seem to update periodically. the voice search is very accurate. there are a decent amount of apps for added content. i mostly stick to the abovementioned sources, but i added crackle for a bit of variety.my only complaint would be about the rewind/fast forward. it's not intuitive, and takes some getting used to. i don't use that feature often, so it's no biggie to me.i did feel a bit weird about not being able to turn it off at first, but i got used to that, too. just make sure to press the home button when you're done for the evening or whatever, because you leave it paused in the middle of a show or something, it won't go to sleep. it remembers your place in whatever you were watching, so no worries about that.i look forward to continued software improvements, and plan on getting a game controller sometime soon, so i can try out the games. amazon fire tv amazon categories,amazon devices,electronics features,streaming media players,consumer electronics,see more amazon fire tv digital hd media streamer (late...",5.0
337,3,"from a roku 3 owner, and now fire tv... this review is to try to offset some of roku employees that are on here trying to knock this device.the first thing you notice after plugging everything in, is a 3-5 minute demo that you can unfortunately not bypass, even if you know your way around these types of devices. you will only see it once, and then you're good to go. the device is small and beautiful. the remote is better than any other device, including roku 3, and my wd tv live.first the pros:- it's the fastest media streamer, by far. that's not only a good thing if you own one, but it will force roku and other companies to stop skimping on the hardware, and firmware updating.- the menu is intuitive and easy to maneuver. you can't move things around yet, but i'm sure they will eventually let you customize your own page. as of now, the apps (which would be at the top, if i could change it) are at the bottom. apps are larger and higher resolution than the roku.- the voice button is amazing. for a first attempt, they almost got it right. i understand this is a proprietary device, so they will always want you to use amazon instant video for your viewing. but this option should search for all of your linked accounts, including hulu, netflix, etc. i'm not sure that they will ever fix this, because they will lose money and viewers. even so, it's still a pro, because it does work well.- streaming quality - wow everything i've tried buffers so quickly, that it's almost already at 1080p when it starts playing. with my roku, netflix looks great, but it takes 5-10 seconds to get there. i currently have 100mbps of internet, so i'm not sure what everyone else goes through, but i can tell you this streams better than roku. period.- overheating and reboots - my roku 3 cannot handle more than a couple of hours of viewing before it decides that was too many rows of stairs. it gets exhausted, and it has to reset itself. this device is more powerful, and after using it all day today, i can say my roku 3 will be immediately up for sale, once they add the time warner cable and hbogo apps.-- plex -- okay, i always blamed my plex for the long delays on my roku. with my internet speeds, i could never understand why it was always loading at 1080p settings, regardless of the bitrate. anyway, i was wrong. it's the device. not only does the fire tv have a much better plex app (which is beautiful, btw), but everything streams at maximum quality within seconds. no re-loading (buffering) during movie playback. and the movies are in a much nicer grid layout, so i don't have to sift through one row to get to a movie selection.now the cons:- obviously it's still missing some apps. you are crazy if you think hbogo will go much longer without being added. the same for other apps. they built it, so they will come.- interface - it is nice, but as i stated in the pros, you can't make changes to it, hopefully just for now. if it stays this way, it will be a little annoying to have to scroll down all the way just to get to my apps.- one major issue that is very upsetting to me, is the fact that they couldn't add two very important things - usb 3.0, and 802.11ac. if amazon claims they were listening, they would also know that these two things would dramatically improve the user experience. i haven't plugged my wd 4tb hard to it yet, but it is a 3.0 hard drive. now it will unfortunately revert to 2.0 speeds. don't build a supposedly forward-thinking device with two things that are now considered dated. i have a feeling this was done to make money off the fire tv 2. thanks for that.overall, it is the best device currently available, and they really made the experience fun. it does make you want to call your cable company and cancel service. buy it...you will not regret it. amazon fire tv amazon categories,amazon devices,electronics features,streaming media players,consumer electronics,see more amazon fire tv digital hd media streamer (late...",5.0
157,3,"best tv streaming box for everyone - from grandma to your computer science professor after having the firetv for about a month now, i can confidently recommend this product for most people. versus the current generation apple tv, chromecast and roku offerings, the firetv is the best value due to it's access to a wide variety of content, build quality and advanced features. it's a device i have recommended to my (almost-elderly) parents my (geeky) friends.best things about the firetv: - it is fast - unlike the roku it does not lag and feels like a high quality product - has amazon prime video access- if you have prime membership, this is the best accessory you can buy. lots of great content from comedy central and newer movies versus netflix. - an appstore with apps games you actually want - plex showtime anytime are the big difference makers imo. - if you have local video files on your network, plex is the way to go. - voice searchworst things about the firetv (which really aren't that bad): - annoying/long intro video upon the first time you boot up - larger power adapter versus apple tv (yes the little things count) - no hbogo until late 2014 - going to be a problem from the folks looking for their game of thrones fix this spring** - no chromecast/airplay like feature unless you have an amazon tablet**if you don't need hbogo right now and don't have a bunch of apple products, stop reading this right now and buy this device. you won't regret it.** see below for ways around thisif you are an advanced user and/or are on the fence this next section is for you.before the firetv, i had 3 apple tv 2's in my house that i used to access hbogo, hulu+, netflix my local media through the infuse application. i had tried roku's, chromecast and other media boxes/home theater pc's and the apple tv worked best for me. while this has served me well there are obvious drawbacks - lack of 1080p video, limited app selection, no games, etc.... which led me to trying the firetv.because the firetv is based on android, android apps can be side loaded on the device and many work fine. the steps below will outline how to get started side loading apps to your firetv. you may want to have a usb keyboard and mouse handy - you'll need them to get a few things running. any old usb keyboard/mouse you have lying around should work ok.(the following links provide the best directions i have come across during my time with the device and have worked for me and should work for you too, but no promises)how to sideload applications to the firetv:1. the first step in loading android apps is getting adb set up on your machine can be done by following amazon's directions - developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/connecting-adb2. after that, you can go ahead and proceed with side loading applications, also by following amazon's directions - developer.amazon.com/sdk/asb/app-install.html3. if you aren't comfortable with working with the command line, and are running windows, you can try this great gui application to automatically side load applications. - forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.phpt2736740once you are able to send android apps (.apk) files to the firetv, i recommend:1. installing mxplayer to allow .mkv .avi video file playback: sites.google.com/site/mxvpen/download2. if your network drive/computer doesn't support plex, try using esfileexplorer to navigate to play back video files - appsapk.com/es-file-explorer/3. airreceiver which mimics the functionality of airplay on an appletv. please note this only supports unencrypted video feeds. this is a paid app, buy play.google.com/store/apps/detailsidcom.softmedia.receiver4. hbogo android app can be installed and works rather well. it does require a mouse to navigate.5. xbmc - if you know what this, you will want it and yes it works. download via xbmc.orgfor the cord cutters out there, i've tried installing aereo slingbox with mixed results. slingbox for tablets loads and opens ok. using the mouse i was able to accept the terms conditions and input my user info. unfortunately it doesn't load the video stream. other folks have had success apparently, so it may be just me. aereo side loads opens fine but i couldn't sign up for a trial as i am 1 town over from being in their current market area. i will update this review if i get any further with either.there are many more apps you may want to try so check out this comprehensive list of app functionality from the reddit.com/r/firetv folks - docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ud6ceslvthwsowde9jlksv9ftlubq3kvdqp6n9gbhe/editgid1337307432this list includes information on emulators roms which i didn't include in this review due to their dubious legality. amazon fire tv amazon categories,amazon devices,electronics features,streaming media players,consumer electronics,see more amazon fire tv digital hd media streamer (late...",5.0

35,3,"love our firetv: voice search will totally spoil you this was so easy to set up. we were up running in less than 10 minutes and wow. this is primarily my hubby's toy (i play on the computer, he flies the tv). voice search is such a timesaver. i used to have to stop whatever i was doing to type in whatever he needed to search for. now, he can handle it. speak and ye shall find. love, love, love this boxthe speed of the video loading is awesome, as is the intuitive search function (amazon knows what he likes, so his lists are more or less pre-filtered so they load faster).i waffled for weeks before buying this. i read tons of reviews finally decided it would be worth the temporary (honey, how do i do this) change in look, feel, etc. (we've been streaming with a roku since about 2009 had the roku xd for a long time, just before the change to firetv).finally, i decided to try it, thinking if hubby had too much difficulty adapting, we'd just send it back (while also trusting amazon to have made a massive leap forward--have never, myself, been disappointed with any of their electronic offerings).i was expecting to have to sync it with our router, sign on to our accounts again and again (amazon, netflix, etc.).nope. plug it in.it turned itself on.updated itself.found my router.was pre-loaded with my amazon account.we were from box to watching in under 10 minutes (there's even a 2 or 3 minute cartoon tutorial that teaches you everything you need to know to stream use your remote--easy breezy).when he wanted to try netflix, he was able to easily click to install an app, then i *painfully* used a grid-keyboard to logon to netflix account (username pwd) only once and we were done.the voice search is such a leap forward. it's incredible and accurate. can voice search by title, genre, director, actor, everything. and it even understands southern. woohooit has 4 times the processing speed and 4 times the memory of our previous roku box wow what a difference in loadtime, resolution, quality of picture/vividness of color. just awesome. what can i say amazon did it again.movie/program descriptions are displayed at the bottom of the screen ( my only quibbling complaint is you can't change the font size on descriptions w/o altering tv resolution, which i won't do). they do have excellent closed captioning functionality for those who need it you can enlarge the fonts there for easy readability.basically, i'm very happy we took the plunge it really was a worthwhile improvement for us (we prefer amazon's video streaming anyway--they have lots more documentaries than the other streaming services).i'm just sorry i waited so long : )---------quick update:not all apps come preloaded on the device, though a ton of others did (pandora, bloomberg, showtime anytime, netflix, vevo, vimeo, watchespn, crackle, huluplus, iheartradio, and tuneinradio).if you have an amazon kindle tablet (i'm guessing like the hdx), you can somehow toss photos from the tablet directly to the fire. meaning, sitting in your living room, you can, apparently, swipe the photo across the screen and it lands on the fire. (don't have that, so can't do that). however, we do have many photos saved to amazon's cloud drive they were all accessible from the firetv console (via the tv, with just a click)--even a short family video we'd uploaded. with no interference from me. just clicked on photos there they were. easy. a very nice feature. amazon fire tv amazon categories,amazon devices,electronics features,streaming media players,consumer electronics,see more amazon fire tv digital hd media streamer (late...",5.0

(i'll probably order a longer usb cable, but the one the kindle comes with is too short to wrap around to the other side.) i wish they'd punched two holes in the back and given us options for which direction the kindle fits.3. it's got a canvassy sort of fabric covering rather than a hard plastic one like my last case.read more all-new amazon fire hd 8 tablet case (7th generation nan amazon devices,kindle store",3.0

(just give the tablet a 180 if you can't get it to stand.) i don't usually like blue, but the marine blue of this cover and the tablet is gorgeous and they match perfectly. there is a nice texture to it that helps immensely with the grip as well as being very attractive. the cutouts are precise and allow for charging without removing the cover. i often have difficulty with close fitting hard plastic cases, but i had no trouble removing this one when i needed to. the only downside is that it does pick up a bit of lint at times. overall, a very nice, classic case. all-new amazon fire hd 8 tablet case (7th generation nan amazon devices,kindle store",5.0

320,30,"simply put: great value, great tablet! 2, let me make things simple for everyone. this is a great tablet and a beautiful device. it has everything 97 of tablet users need and want. the 3 that are power users can pay up for an ipad.amazon prime is a must if you have one of these tablets. and if you already have amazon prime it is a no-brainer to buy this tablet if you are looking for an entertainment device that also gives you the ability to check email and surf the web as needed.people complain that one app here or there is missing. if you want the tried and true, the basics, then you have nothing to worry about. of course there is a weather app. of course there is a nyt app. all the 'normal' stuff is there. sure, a particular game or more specialized app may not be available but anything most people actually 'want/need' is going to be there.this is not a device for the office. if you want to review spreadsheets then clearly do not buy it. that goes without saying.as for the actual device it feels well put together. the plastic back actually felt closer to metal to me. it has a solid feel. the screen is beautiful and has plenty of resolution for watching movies, surfing the web, etc. it is also sufficient for reading, though the kindle paperwhite admittedly has clearer print so if you only plan to read on this device then get the paperwhite. (also, i find the word runner feature to be quite intriguing- in fact i think we all may read using this method in a few years.)before buying the device i read that load times are slow and switching between apps is trouble. what i have found is that it may take a second for your movie or app to load...but we are talking a second...or two max! if you can't wait two seconds for something then i don't know what to say.read more fire hd 8 tablet nan electronics,amazon devices",5.0
170,30,"disappointed first impressions 1, as a background, i am a retired information systems professional and i am writing my first impressions of the fire hd 8 from the perspective of being a long-time kindle user. i have all the current e-readers and fire devices from amazon including the basic kindle, the paperwhite (2013,2014,2015 models), the fire hd6, fire hd7, fire hdx7 and fire hdx8.9 (3rd and 4th generation). here is a summary of my initial impressions of the new fire hd8.amazon removed the fire hd7, the fire hdx7 and the fire hdx8.9 and replaced them with the fire hd (7 screen), fire hd 8 and fire hd 10.hardware:what comes in the box: the hd8 fire, a short usb cord and a power adapter. finally, amazon ships a power adapter with their fires so you can charge and use the device right out of the box. (picture attached)size: the hd8 is longer than the older hd7 but the same width as the discontinued hd7. it is also thinner. (8.4x5.0x0.3 versus 7.5x5.0x0.4). i have large hands and can hold it with one hand, but even with my hands, i really need to use both hands. because it is longer, it seem top heavy to me. the back is also slick and slippery to hold. mine has a habit of sliding off the table.display: the resolution of the screen is 1280 x 800 same as the hd 7 but the pixel density is lower due to the longer screen length. in practical use, though, you can't tell the difference. the display is nice and bright but barely readable in bright sunlight. one nice touch is that now, you can choose your own wallpaper! it comes with 9 stock images and if you don't like one of them, you can choose your own image in your amazon photos folder.read more fire hd 8 tablet nan electronics,amazon devices",3.0

763,45,"i had low expectations, but i was pleasantly surprised. i had low expectations, but i was pleasantly surprised. but, keep in mind that this is not an ipad or typical android tablet. this is an amazon media and shopping machine. it is well built, has good battery life, reasonably fast and responsive, dual band wifi, sd card slot, decent display and so-so camera. no tablet is going to give you awesome sound, but i was surprised at how well the two speakers sound on this tablet. no tablet it going to give you a great camera, and this tablet is probably on the lower end of the spectrum - it works, but it won't be your go-to camera for important shots. this tablet excels at playing amazon content - music and video. it is a great reader, although a little heavy compared to a kindle device. it makes shopping easy - perhaps too easy. the os is based on android, but don't look for google play or google apps in general - this is nothing like an android tablet. finally, you can't beat the price. i think amazon wants to get these in the hands of as many people as possible. i would have given this 4.5 stars if that option was available. i didn't give it 5 stars only because it is not a general purpose tablet. this is a dramatic improvement over the fire 7. the integration of alexa is flawless and works very well - depends on whether or not you have an echo and on how you feel about that product. i have an echo and find it useful (not essential but useful). i find myself using alexia on this tablet more than i thought i would. all-new fire hd 8 tablet with alexa nan electronics,amazon devices",4.0
613,45,"insanely good budget tablet 1, all right so i was scrolling through the reviews and read some pretty ridiculous reasons to not give this tablet five stars. one such was that the tablet weighed a whole 3 oz more and that resulted in a 3 star review. let me start off by saying if that is the reason for giving a crap review that is ridiculous. it says the tablet weight depends on the manufacturing. the other funny one is that someone is upset with the special offers on the front screen. that's why you get a cheap and good tablet. it even says in the discription that there will be ads on the lock screen. it takes a second to swipe up and unlock the screen. so the bad reviews are just reviews by people looking to nit-pick.this tablet is exactly what amazon was describing. it is cheap, looks good, loads apps quickly, expandable storage, good speakers, decent screen and all while staying under 80 bucks.the start up didn't take long and it came preloaded with my account on it. for 80 dollars this is a good buy and the complaints on the wieght and the ads are ridiculous reasons to give this tablet a shabby review.buy this tablet if you want a cheap e-reader that can also sure the web, watch movies and shows, check facebook or twitter, or read books on. ignore the negative reviews and you won't be disappointed. all-new fire hd 8 tablet with alexa nan electronics,amazon devices",5.0

34,45,"great value for the price, i'm pleased so happy with my new fire and i wish i had bought more! some of the pros of this tablet are it has alexa, memory expansion slot, and a nice size. at 8 inches it is the perfect size to take on the go and ebook . it is a little thicker than some of the more expensive tablets on the market but because of this it seems more durable especially for kids. the apps and games seem to run smoothly and the colors are good on screen. i install the google play store and connect to the google play store to download apps is easy, like youtube. without the google play store you will stuck with the amazon store and apps.i often use the tablet to watch videos with my meidong e6 bluetooth headphones meidong e6anc bluetooth headphones active noise cancelling headphones wireless stereo headphones with microphone, ergonomic design for kids adult-black this is a excellent headphones with noise cancelling at an affordable price if you are looking for, this is right for you. and it has two colors for choice, black and rosegold,i have bought two. i did some research and found that the meidong company is an audio electronics innovator specializing in bluetooth/anc headphones, vibration speakers,wifi speakers. no wonder their headphones sound really nice, also recommend.back to here,the only 1 cons i would say about that the tablet has two camera, rear is 2mp and front is 0.3mp, very very basic. having two speakers but the speaker is not great.overall, it is a good value for the price,this tablet can do whatever other tablets those cost twice or triple the price do. all-new fire hd 8 tablet with alexa nan electronics,amazon devices",5.0

170,35,"great basic tablet for amazon fans 9, as a background, i am a retired information systems professional and i am writing my first impressions of the new fire hd 8 released on september 21, 2016 from the perspective of being a long-term kindle user. i have all the current e-readers and fire devices from amazon including the basic kindle, the paperwhite (2013,2014,2015 models), the fire hd6, fire hd7, fire hdx7 and fire hdx8.9 (3rd and 4th generation), the old fire hd 8 and the fire hd 10. here is a summary of my initial impressions of the new fire hd8.amazon has replaced the original hd 8 released in 2015 with an all-new hd 8. amazon is also removing the fire hd6, which is a shame as it is a great little tablet.the new hd 8 differs from the old version as follows:best new feature:the price has been reduced! the 16 gb version of the old device cost 169.99 with special offers (ads). the new 16 gb version costs 89.99 and you can get a 32 hb version for 30 more.secretly removed:amazon has removed the ability to mirror your display on miracast devices such as tvs. now that feature is now only available on generation 4 and 5 fires including last years hd 8. however, you can still cast prime videos to a firetv or fire stick.what comes in the box:the hd8 fire, a short 3-foot usb cord and a power adapter so you can charge and use the device right out of the box.size:the new hd8 is a fraction thicker than the 2015 hd8. leather cases for the old hd 8 will fit the new hd 8 but hard shell cases will not. however the auto wake feature of some older cases won't work.one complaint i had about the earlier versions was that the back was very slick and slippery to hold without a case.read more fire hd 8 tablet with alexa nan electronics,amazon devices",5.0
408,35,"amazon did it right this time, really enjoying my tablet! (4 updates) -- 4th update has some tips 4, i am thrilled with the new fire hd8 - even before it gets alexa! at that time i will likely be ecstatic! i am far from a tablet novice - i had the original fire the 50 fire the samsung galaxy tab 3 and the galaxy tab s 10.5. my phones have always been samsung flagship phones, currently the s7 edge. i say this to show that i 1) have experience with kindle fires, and 2) generally tend to have high standards for my most used devices -- i know what is a good tablet and what is a so-so tablet. admittedly, my previous fires have been so-so, but i wanted something inexpensive yet adequate to take places with me instead of my galaxy tab s 10.5.my hd8 is the 32gb option, with offers. most users will likely be fine with 16gb and perhaps an added 32gb or 64gb sd card. however, i know how i use my devices, so went with the 32gb option, as well as a 64gb micro sd card. in the 48 hours i have had my new fire, it has become my device of choice, even over my 500 samsung (more convenient size). i use the large samsung tablet as a computer replacement whereas the new fire replaces my two 7 inch tablets as the go to device.before receiving it, i wasn't sure about the low resolution (1280 x 800) on this tab, but honestly, it's not a problem! sure, it's not bright and beautiful like my tab s ... but its crisp, clean, and clear. the colors are sufficient, but not vibrant, sadly. (the comparison photo below is the hd8 (2016) and fire 7 (2015).sound is quite good, with good volume. the speakers are on the left side when portrait, on top (or bottom) in landscape. i prefer them on top. the sound is good enough that you can enjoy a movie without having to use earphones, unless in a noisy environment, in which case you would likely want to use earphones anyway.read more fire hd 8 tablet with alexa nan electronics,amazon devices",5.0
518,35,"a great upgrade from the fire 7. a great buy at this price! 1, first off,i appreciate you reading this review :) just so you get a little background on me, we are major tech users. we have multiple tablets from apple,samsung,and asus. this fire tablet is comparable in a different way. this tablet uses a amazon based operating system, fire os. so no play store or itunes... as a prime member however, this tablet is an incredible value because you get instant access to all of your prime benifits. ive had a chance to really put this product thru its paces over the past 2 days. i ordered 2 of these tablets so me and my wife could really put these to use. we have gone thru 3 full power cycles (fully charging and fully draining the battery thru use) it does get 10-11 hours of hefty use so battery life is a plus! this tablet is a keeper. screen looks fantastic. colors seem to be just slightly dull however the resoloution for everyday use is perfect for this price point. speed is snappy enough for basic use and handles more complex tasks and games without much issue. on a passmark benchmark test i got a score of 3377. however the second hd 8 constantly grades about 30-35 points lower. so it is a possibility that even tho you have the same exact tablet,they might be built slightly different so performance will vary. at this price point i didnt expect them to come out exactly the same. this tablet is bassically the same specs as the samsung tab a at half the price! oh and the hd 8 actually offers a slightly better resoloution then the samsung! minus one star for the wifi connection. i have lost connection several times on both tablets. seems to only happen on my 5g connection.also the screen being so reflective,it is impossible to use at all outdoors.also sadly is a fingerprint magnet.read more fire hd 8 tablet with alexa nan electronics,amazon devices",4.0
585,46,"this fire tablet is much better than the last one. please improve the freetime experience! we got this the day it came out. i have a four year old daughter, and she loves it! we have an ipad for her, but it was getting very expensive because so many of the games have buttons that you can click which then tell you about things you need to buy and she would have to have them. this tablet restricts all in app purchasing. yay! we tried the older version of this tablet but it kept freezing and did not perform well. but so far, this one works well. i have two requests to amazon, and i am hoping that someone from amazon reads my review so they can make this change. please change amazon freetime so that it puts the story apps that are under apps into the books sections. there are many wonderful stories that are read out loud but they are in the apps section instead of the books section, so then when i restrict her tablet to books only, she can't access them. i would love it so much if you they would fix this. a few examples of the stories she can't access when i restrict her to books because they are considers apps are the following: nighty night!, charlie brown's, the berenstain bears, and dino-store story. the other recommendation i have is to please hide from view the activities that are restricted. as it is now, she can see all the apps but gets an error message when she selects them. i really like this product, and i think it so great for children. it just needs a few little improvements to the freetime interface. all-new fire hd 8 kids edition tablet nan electronics,amazon devices",5.0

285,46,"the perfect kids tablet the fire hd 8 kids tablet is essentially an hd 8 with the kids cover, freetime, and a 2 year warranty. lots of improvements over the previous kids edition tablet such as dual band wifi, higher quality 720p screen, dolby stereo speakers, double the storage, and increased battery life.the kids cover allows your little one to get a good grip on it and also provides exceptional protection from drops. the ips screen has excellent viewing angles, vibrant colors, and offers plenty of brightness indoors. however once you move outside the screen will wash out if you're in the sun. the dual speakers give you true stereo sound and offer plenty of volume. it's a shame that the cameras don't offer higher resolution, but none the less the rear cam does take a decent picture even if your hands aren't that steady. should you fill up the internal storage you can add up to a 256gb microsd card.freetime has a wealth of content, and it includes a kid-safe web browser that will only load sites that are whitelisted by you or amazon. if you don't want your child using the browser then it can be turned off. you can also restrict access to certain categories, set time limits, and view what your children are watching and reading with the parent dashboard. after the first year there is a nominal fee to continue using the service.tips:- you can view amazon videos offline when not connected to wifi. switch to your adult profile and download the video(s). now go into settings, profiles and family library, select your child profile, add content, videos, and select your videos.- you can sideload google play and gain access to even more apps such as youtube kids.- you can set freetime to only allow entertainment content after daily educational goals have been met. all-new fire hd 8 kids edition tablet nan electronics,amazon devices",5.0
34,43,"kindle 8th generation kids bundle i bought 2 of these for christmas presents and i have to say they aren't very kid friendly. every kindle i've had in the past has been pretty easy to use, this one has a lot of options that i think could be elsewhere to make it easier for a child to navigate. they have an easier time using the other devices (kindle fire, or kindle app on their other tablets) which is unfortunate because i wanted them to be able to have something strictly for reading. also for a kids bundle its very disappointing that most children's books don't work with this device. no where on the kids bundle page does it state this is an 8th generation kindle. now, i have a few kindles and have bought new ones as they come out, but i haven't followed close enough to know this is an 8th generation without that information available on the page. i planned on buying these devices so bought a bunch of books listed as available for e-readers 5th generation. i assumed since it was the latest one listed, and my new devices didn't have anything listed, it was the latest. i just found out today that its an 8th generation and a lot of books aren't available on this device, with hopes that will change in the future. so now i have a lot of money spent on books they have to read on their old devices (the devices with games and access to the internet and videos). i spent extra money on 2 new devices so they had something to use daily without that access, all to find out their age appropriate books can't be read on their new devices. i think this information should be available to parents who are looking for a device they can sit their kids down with and not have to worry about them not focusing on something so important to them. reading is important to children of all ages, and they can only read at their own levels.read more kindle for kids bundle with the latest kindle e-reader nan amazon devices,kindle accessories",3.0

138,43,"loved the concept but execution falls short - and customer service was terrible! i loved the concept of an ereader that would not be screen time. however, i have found several drawbacks to this version when compared to prior kindles i have owned. first, this product has no speaker of any kind, so it cannot play audible books or even do text to speech unless you use wireless headphones. a big loss - no current kindle ereader can play audible books -- only older generation kindle ereaders or the fire (which has the problem of introducing videos to reading time) - and sometimes, my daughter just wants to be read to while she follows along. second, it operates slowly. third, the freetime service is so poorly organized that it is very unlikely that my daughter will be able to find anything she wants there. the categories are not the types of categories you might see in bookstore - e.g. mystery, biography, early chapter books, realistic fiction, series, etc - but an odd collection of categories - e.g. ballet, frozen, disney, trucks, etc. most of the options seem very commercial and not the types of books i would want her to read. and there is no description of the book (like the blurb on the amazon website) - so there is no way other than the title (and the unhelpful category) to tell her what the book is about before she downloads and starts to read it. finally, when i called customer service hoping for a clearer explanation of how to move around within free time, and to put books from my amazon account in the freetime library, i got a representative who took long breaks between each one of my questions (presumably because she did not know the answer and had to look it up) and who was very difficult to understand because of her strong accent.read more kindle for kids bundle with the latest kindle e-reader nan amazon devices,kindle accessories",3.0

136,2,"fun, durable, only a few minor issues i purchased the kindle fire hd after returning a lenovo idea pad. i have also had experience with ipads. having said that, the kindle fire hd is an exceptional value for the money. the screen is fantastic. glare is kept to a minimum, colors a bright and vibrant, text is clear and easily read, movies look phenomenal in hd. also, the sound quality and volume is bar-none for a device this size. the touch screen is responsive and shortcuts like tapping, double tapping, and pinch zoom work great. the size, weight and thickness are great for portability. it is easily slipped into the interior pocket of a jacket and takes up little room in a backpack. the weight and size makes it easy to hold with just one hand and the rubberized back panel is great for grip. the amazon store provides an almost unlimited supply, of books, movies, tv shows, music, magazines, and newspapers that is only improved with a subscription to amazon prime. now, for the negatives. the power button and volume rocker are tough to find as they are flush with device and provide little tactile feedback when looking for them. i solved this problem by putting a thin strip of colored tape on the side of the device that has these buttons. the amazon app store is very limited when compared to the full android app store. hopefully the app library will only grow with the device's popularity. apps from the full android store can be side loaded in a few easy steps but please be aware that not all apps will work with the kindle. lastly, the carousel home screen is about as useful as a spoon is for cutting steak. say you are finished reading a magazine and want to switch to another app, when you go back to the home screen, the magazine you just read and are done with is the first thing you see.read more kindle fire hd 7"" nan amazon devices,kindle store",4.0

283,11,"more evolutionary than revolutionary, but worth the upgrade 11, this is the fifth e-ink kindle reader that i've bought. my wife and i were early adopters of kindle, and when we buy a new kindle, the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line. i loved the original paperwhite, with its small size, touch screen, front-lighting, and virtual keyboard. the all-new paperwhite is a definite step up, and for me, it was worth the move, but others will have to decide for themselves. if you read a lot, and you don't already have one of the newer e-ink kindles, it's definitely worth upgrading to the paperwhite. if you have the original paperwhite, the upgrade is well worth considering. although i've only had the new paperwhite a few hours, i'm already glad i upgraded. here's a summary of my initial impressions of the new paperwhite.size: it's the same size as the original paperwhite - 6.7x4.6x0.36. the weight has been reduced slightly from 7.8 ounces to 7.3 ounces. the paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand, which is how i usually read. the really good news is that if you have a case for the original paperwhite, it will also fit the new one (thank you, amazon). if you buy a case, i highly recommend that the case include the magnetic autowake function. it's much easier to turn the kindle on and off without fumbling for the small power switch.lighting: the front-lighting is noticeably improved over the original paperwhite, which had slightly visible shadows coming from the bottom edge where the led lights were located. (it didn't bother me, but some readers were annoyed by that.) i couldn't see any shadows in the new paperwhite, where the lighting appears brighter and more uniform. with the paperwhite's front lighting, you'll never need a clip-on light, even in total darkness.read more kindle paperwhite nan amazon devices,kindle accessories",5.0

134,11,"good as a first paperwhite, not worthy of an upgrade 12, this review is for the second generation kindle paperwhite. like all kindle e-readers before it, this is a great product. however, i am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year's model. for this review, i focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year's model. also, i found somethings misrepresented or confusing in the advertising, so i will try to clear them up.hardwaredesign - the kindle white has a nice look and shape. it fits well and is easy to hold in one hand. it's fairly light, so it doesn't tire the hands too much. i can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands. its design is very similar to the previous paperwhite - almost identical. the height and width are the same, the buttons are in the same location, and although this version is slightly lighter, it is not noticeable.display - although not a huge improvement from last year's model, the display is one of the best features of the paperwhite. like most e-readers, the paperwhite uses digital ink technology. this model employs a more advanced version. in addition, the lighting has been upgraded, so among other things, it is more evenly lit. together, they make for incredible viewing. in my opinion, it's one of the best digital ink e-reader display on the market. i really enjoy reading on it, text look very sharp and crisp, with little to no eye strain.processor - the paperwhite has an upgraded processor, which means smoother page turns and navigation. i am able to open books, flip pages, and navigate menus fairly quickly. there is barely any lag as i flip through many pages at a time. also, the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all.read more kindle paperwhite nan amazon devices,kindle accessories",3.0

518,40,"a huge improvement over last years release and for half the price 5, thanks for taking the time to read this review!this re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. i can now say alexa and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my harmon kardon onyx speaker. i found myself yelling at last years echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen. we will be ordering a second device so we can try out its multi-room voice recognition technology. amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. so bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word alexa on a side note the basic amazon music unlimited will only work on one of your devices. not one at a time, but one. if you want to use it on more than one dot or echo, you have to purchase a multi-device plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/amazonmusicunlimited the main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (at your own risk of course). i have both the amazon tap and the echo. unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices.read more echo dot (2nd generation) - black nan amazon devices,electronics,kindle store",5.0

140,40,"the smartest of them all!!! (check out the video for a quick demo) 10, having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, i've seen scores of smart devices come and go. until now, nobody quite got it right. in the echo dot, amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software. i've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but amazon. we're talking major players like samsung and google who have been at it for much longer than amazon. the main problem is that excellent products like the samsung smart things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (nest, honeywell, phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support i wanted, so i'd still end up needing my tablet or phone. thanks to fantastic third party support, the dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands. to me, this is the exceedingly rare product that i didn't know i needed, and now can't live without. similar to the smartphone and tablet i use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.if you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try. add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be!update: after a bit more time with the dot, or maybe i should say dots since i went out and bought another one for my living room, i've come up with a few tips.1. use the best speakers you can with it. i found that while bluetooth was convenient i got much better sound out of my jbl duet computer speakers.2. take the time to voice train alexa at least once.read more echo dot (2nd generation) - black nan amazon devices,electronics,kindle store",5.0

283,4,"more evolutionary than revolutionary, but worth the upgrade 11, this is the fifth e-ink kindle reader that i've bought. my wife and i were early adopters of kindle, and when we buy a new kindle, the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line. i loved the original paperwhite, with its small size, touch screen, front-lighting, and virtual keyboard. the all-new paperwhite is a definite step up, and for me, it was worth the move, but others will have to decide for themselves. if you read a lot, and you don't already have one of the newer e-ink kindles, it's definitely worth upgrading to the paperwhite. if you have the original paperwhite, the upgrade is well worth considering. although i've only had the new paperwhite a few hours, i'm already glad i upgraded. here's a summary of my initial impressions of the new paperwhite.size: it's the same size as the original paperwhite - 6.7x4.6x0.36. the weight has been reduced slightly from 7.8 ounces to 7.3 ounces. the paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand, which is how i usually read. the really good news is that if you have a case for the original paperwhite, it will also fit the new one (thank you, amazon). if you buy a case, i highly recommend that the case include the magnetic autowake function. it's much easier to turn the kindle on and off without fumbling for the small power switch.lighting: the front-lighting is noticeably improved over the original paperwhite, which had slightly visible shadows coming from the bottom edge where the led lights were located. (it didn't bother me, but some readers were annoyed by that.) i couldn't see any shadows in the new paperwhite, where the lighting appears brighter and more uniform. with the paperwhite's front lighting, you'll never need a clip-on light, even in total darkness.read more kindle paperwhite nan amazon devices,kindle store,kindle accessories",5.0
291,4,"a new step forward for me in reading on my kindle! 9, i have loved and used my kindle keyboard for years now but i missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark. i purchased a kindle fire and i also use an ipad 3 but for ease of reading on my eyes i prefer the kindle keyboard. i wanted to get a kindle paperwhite e-reader but i held off until this new generation was released before i spent my money. i got this because i wanted to reduce my eyestrain from reading in the evening and i just love this new tablet. it offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced eyestrain and high clarity and contrast of the text.i have added a video of the kindle paperwhite compared to a kindle keyboard and a kindle fire. if you have any questions please feel free to contact me and i will try to answer them.i love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear. i use the kindle because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books. reading was my number one hobby my entire life and i just loved it. the kindle has brought back that reading experience and now with the crisper text and lit screen i can enjoy my reading in every type of environment. i laid my kindle keyboard and the new kindle paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new paperwhite. the new lighting system and screen clarity is where this paperwhite design really is outstanding. with better contrast, lighting and custom designed fonts, the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e-reader before. with 221 ppi (pixels per inch) this screen provides a 768 by 1024 pixel screen that just makes the old kindle keyboard look old fashioned. technology certainly does move quickly on.read more kindle paperwhite nan amazon devices,kindle store,kindle accessories",5.0
134,4,"good as a first paperwhite, not worthy of an upgrade 12, this review is for the second generation kindle paperwhite. like all kindle e-readers before it, this is a great product. however, i am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year's model. for this review, i focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year's model. also, i found somethings misrepresented or confusing in the advertising, so i will try to clear them up.hardwaredesign - the kindle white has a nice look and shape. it fits well and is easy to hold in one hand. it's fairly light, so it doesn't tire the hands too much. i can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands. its design is very similar to the previous paperwhite - almost identical. the height and width are the same, the buttons are in the same location, and although this version is slightly lighter, it is not noticeable.display - although not a huge improvement from last year's model, the display is one of the best features of the paperwhite. like most e-readers, the paperwhite uses digital ink technology. this model employs a more advanced version. in addition, the lighting has been upgraded, so among other things, it is more evenly lit. together, they make for incredible viewing. in my opinion, it's one of the best digital ink e-reader display on the market. i really enjoy reading on it, text look very sharp and crisp, with little to no eye strain.processor - the paperwhite has an upgraded processor, which means smoother page turns and navigation. i am able to open books, flip pages, and navigate menus fairly quickly. there is barely any lag as i flip through many pages at a time. also, the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all.read more kindle paperwhite nan amazon devices,kindle store,kindle accessories",3.0

437,6,"nice tablet with sharp display 4, to sum up what i will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation fire hd and the 500 or more you can spend on a wi-fi version of the ipad. overall, if you consider the price and the functionality i think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new hd fire. if you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, i'd recommend the regular kindle fire hd that is only 139. if you're comparing last year's hd model to this version and it is operating fine, i'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the fire hdx to the original fire hd as well as this year's model of the fire hd, but also some of the features for a first-time user.consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the kindle fire hd, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the fire hdx attempted to download and install several operating software updates. software updates on a kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. consistent with the fire hd, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a tv show, and reading a book. it took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.read more kindle fire hdx 7"" nan amazon devices,kindle store,buy a kindle",4.0

don't laugh - the first episode of the wonder woman tv series from the 70's. the display on this fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the fire hd. for you technical folks out there, the display is 1,920 x 1,200 with 50 more pixels per inch than the fire hd.wi-fi connectivity:the initial wi-fi setup took some time as it wouldn't remember the password for my router after each software update / crash / reboot series. after the final operating software update i mentioned above, however, it was fairly easy to connect to the internet via wi-fi.my standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of wi-fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. in this comparison, i had this hdx version of the fire sitting next to last year's and this year's version of the hd fire, as well as last year's 8.9 hd fire, motorola razr smartphone, my ipad 2 (yes, the kindle guy uses an ipad for work), and the first-generation 7 fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a wi-fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.my normal website test is to hit the mobile websites of foxnews, cnn, my personalized yahoo page, google, and the houston chronicle. the ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the hdx (houston chronicle and cnn), and for the other sites i couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. when i went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7 kindle fire hd yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the fire hd but i attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the hdx.sound / music playback:the two speakers are located in the back of the kindle fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. my test of this feature was cranking up van halen's panama to maximum volume (i always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and i would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker. the dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass. however, i am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as i am in the front: i want to be able to hear whatever i am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like i am). while the cover for this version has not shipped yet - why aren't the covers released at the same time - i imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers. the x-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.email setup:consistent with previous versions of the fire, email setup was very easy for my main gmail account, both with the software came with the fire but my primary use of an existing app called enhanced email i purchased here in the amazon app store. i did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem - it took about a minute to setup my main google account - and i was able to send and receive emails as well as synch my online calendar via google's calendar and contacts. for those of you asking yourself why am i using the enhanced email program, the simple answer is like many of you i have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. the lazy person in me appreciates that as i don't like getting out of the lazy chair once i'm settled in!new tabs and screen layout:in addition to the normal tabs amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the fire hd, i purchased the one with special offers and the only ad i have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.reading books:turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same. amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-ink kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as i can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be. if there is an easier way to do it, i can't find it and maybe i should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it). for those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app/a here in the amazon app store.bluetooththere is a bluetooth connection, and i did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the fire stream music through my car stereo. there were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.camera:there is a camera on this model - it faces the front or toward the user / reader. focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and amazon will by default store your pictures in the cloud - which counts against your storage allotment. i'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.charger:unlike previous models of the fire, this one does include a charger! if you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for 20 which always seemed kind of silly for amazon to do.mayday button:a new feature with this model, and not included on this year's regular model of the fire, is the introduction of the mayday button. basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent. i haven't pressed the button yet to try it out, as i think i would feel pretty dumb: when they ask me how can they help, i don't want to say i just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say hi' for purposes of this review.what i wish it had: a case that was ready to go and shipped when the fire was ready (why are we waiting). a case is very important in order to protect your investment. also, i'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance i mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.overall, at 229 for the 16gb of memory model (309 for 64 gb of memory) i think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch tv and movies, and a whole lot of other things. adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while i try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff i do at home with the business apps that are available here in the amazon app store and other places around the internet i can also work on excel and word-compatible files when i have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be. if you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model fire, i would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 gb. if you're comparing last year's hd model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, i'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the kindle fire hd at 139. read more kindle fire hdx 7"" nan amazon devices,kindle store,buy a kindle",4.0

for the hdx. if you search on youtube for hdx blue haze, you can find a video showing the issue. amazon has updated their learn more link with the following info:to achieve the perfect color accuracy on kindle fire hdx 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, leds. blue leds allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.as a result of using these blue leds, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. all displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the kindle fire hdx 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.if this is something that you think would bother you, i'd recommend taking a look at the youtube video or taking a look at the hdx at a local best buy or office superstore. i've also uploaded a user image here of my hdx with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/b00dopno4m/).the amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. with the free prime trial subscription, you can check out the prime instant video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. for videos, music, and books, the amazon selection is at or near the top of the list for apps, much less so. 90 of the top 100 apps are available on amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with google or apple.it's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall i put this ... less than stellar (look up sturgeon's law). if there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. the apps that will likely never become available on the kindle fire ecosystem are those apps that require google services (i.e., anything that uses google location services). one ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the google play store onto an amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto kindle fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. if the app you are sideloading requires a google service to work, though, it will not run on the fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.like the other kindle fire tablets, as well as the apple ipad and the google nexus, the kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-sd slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. this is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. if the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32gb or 64gb versions, or pay the additional price for the 4g version, which is available on the 7 tablet for the first time. also, if all of your content is on itunes or on google play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. as is true of apple and google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.something new this year is the ability to download prime instant videos. i verified that i can download prime instant videos to my kindle fire hdx. however, that option is not available for all movies and tv shows. it looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. so, for example, i was able to download casablanca but not able to download the avengers even though both are part of the prime instant video collection and both are available for free streaming.update: adding a bit from a reply in the comments: amazon is clearly looking at the enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. they've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for vpn and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to exchange, and are including officesuite for productivity. there are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both google and apple, particularly the latter, have more options. when vpn support arrives, i'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.so how does this kindle fire hdx differ from the previous generation kindle fire hddisplay: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). it's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. this display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and i would have to agree. amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. while there is definitely a noticeable improvement, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. for that, you'll need an eink reader like the kindle paperwhite.sound: as far as i can tell, the sound is about the same. this was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with dolby stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.size and weight: noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) and noticeably smaller (7.3 x 5.0 x 0.35 vs. 7.6 x 5.4 x 0.4). this is a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time.processor: it's a *lot* faster (2.2ghz quad-core, top-of-the-line cpu, compared to 1.2ghz dual-core). this tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. every game i've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations.build: a redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find! this is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.camera: if there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, i'm not able to see it. it's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or skype. like last year's model, there is no rear camera. if this is important to you, you'll need the 8.9 version.hdmi output: this is the one area where last year's model wins. amazon has removed the hdmi out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). no other tablet that i'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you should be able to purchase one of last year's models fairly cheaply.battery life: the same, at 11 hours. however, amazon has added a special reading mode to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 17 hours. i did not test this. for my own personal use, the battery life is adequate.price: it's more expensive (229 vs. 199) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a 20 extra last year, so the actual difference in price is 10. for what you're getting, that price increase is definitely justified.it has an updated os and updated feature software (including the free unlimited mayday customer support feature). the software updates include the ability to download some prime instant videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved x-ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with goodreads (coming soon), and the like.where i noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. the default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. the recommended for you display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.there is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. if you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the about the author link, the sync to furthest page read link, and so on.the kindle freetime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. if you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, amazon has you covered.you can now also schedule quiet time on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. frankly, i doubt i'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your words with friends game.mayday: this is a huge gamble by amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. this isn't a feature for a techie like me and i didn't use it (although i was sorely tempted). from the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, i believe, although i can't help wondering what will happen on christmas day!). if you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the kindle fire hdx your best choice.how does this tablet rank against the competition there are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the google nexus 7 and the just-announced apple ipad mini with retina display.display: all three devices have retina displays, with the 7 hdx and the nexus at 1920x1200 (323 ppi) and the 8 ipad mini at 2048x1536 (326 ppi). all three displays are stunning. amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. while this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (i'd pick the paperwhite), i can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors.it's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the hdx and nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the ipad mini is 4:3. where this matters is watching video. if you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. if you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the hdx and nexus. apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.sound: the hdx has dolby digital surround sound the nexus has frauenhofer surround sound the ipad mini has stereo sound. the ipad mini also makes the same mistake that amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). if you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. the hdx, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.networking: the hdx and the ipad mini both have dual band, dual antenna (mimo) wi-fi. the nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. all things being equal, i would expect the nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.size and weight:hdx: 7.3 x 5.0 x 0.35 and 10.7 oz.nexus: 7.9 x 4.5 x 0.34 and 10.24 oz.ipad mini: 7.87 x 5.3 x 0.29 and 11.68 oz.there's really nothing to choose from here. all three are small, thin, and light. the ipad mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.processor:hdx: 2.2 ghz quad-core snapdragon 800 processor, 2gb memorynexus: 1.5ghz quad-core snapdragon s4 pro, 2gb memoryipad mini: 64-bit dual-core a7, 1gb memorythe hdx and ipad come out ahead of the nexus on processing power while the hdx and nexus come out ahead of the ipad mini on memory. the a7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core snapdragon. these are all pretty powerful tablets.cameras: both the nexus and the ipad mini have 1.2 mp front and 5mp rear cameras. the hdx only has a front-facing camera. if you expect to take pictures with your tablet, the hdx isn't for you.battery life: hdx 11 hours (17 hours when reading) nexus 9 hours ipad mini 10 hours. amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.expansion: none of them have a microsd slot they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.parental controls: all of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. amazon goes farther, though, with the kindle free time and kindle free time unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. if you are buying a first tablet for a child, i'd choose the kindle fire hd. at only 139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the hdx has.enterprise: as soon as amazon releases its update, it will add vpn and network printing support. i believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. for real productivity, though, personally i'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.support: amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new mayday system. apple comes in second, with apple and amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. this is an area where google does not shine.price: the hdx and nexus win this one, hands down. both are priced at 229 vs. 399 for the new ipad mini. neither google nor amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.from my own perspective, there is no single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. if you already have amazon prime, the hdx is a no-brainer, with the access to the prime instant video and the kindle owners' lending library. if you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, amazon wins there, as well, with the 17-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. if you want apps, apple and google both have far more choices. if you want to watch movies, i'd pick either the hdx or the nexus, as apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. if price is a factor, then you should pick either the hdx or the nexus.if you're heavily invested in the apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iphone or ipad and all of your content is on itunes, the hdx really isn't the tablet for you. similarly, if you love browsing google play for apps to play on your samsung galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on amazon (although, as i note above, most of the google play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). if you love your google now or siri, neither of which will ever be available on amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.the bottom line: this tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into amazon content and amazon services. if you have amazon prime and you have amazon ebooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. the price is low, particularly for what you get, and it's a small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. this really is one of the top tablets in its class.note: as others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. unlike some others, i had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. it took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.update:now that i have a kindle fire hd and a kindle fire hdx tablet, i'm in a little better position to talk about which one i'd recommend:you should get the kindle fire hdx if:- you're a techie who wants the latest and greatest, the best display, the fastest processor.- you need a camera for skype or other video app.- you play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- the size and weight matter to you, even in such small increments as this.- you think you will need the mayday technical support.you should get the kindle fire hd if:- price is a factor. 90 cheaper is not an insignificant amount. this really is an excellent value for the money.- you want an inexpensive tablet for a child (and, for this case, the lack of a camera might well be a plus)- all you want is a basic tablet for reading books, playing music, watching the occasional video, playing words with friends, and the like. while the screen on the hd isn't as stunning as is it on the hdx, this is still a true hd screen and it is very good.i check back pretty regularly, so if you have a question, please feel free to ask and i'll do my best to answer it. read more kindle fire hdx 7"" nan amazon

437,6,"nice tablet with sharp display to sum up what i will tell you about in the details below, for 229 you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer - especially if you compare it to the 199 for last year's first-generation fire hd and the 500 or more you can spend on a wi-fi version of the ipad. overall, if you consider the price and the functionality i think this is a great tool / toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device: the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new hd fire. if you are a first-time tablet buyer, where price vs. value is a key consideration, or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids, i'd recommend the regular kindle fire hd that is only 139. if you're comparing last year's hd model to this version and it is operating fine, i'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of that one.my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the fire hdx to the original fire hd as well as this year's model of the fire hd, but also some of the features for a first-time user.consistent with my experience with setup of this year's model of the kindle fire hd, setup took a long time: despite being a brand new product, the fire hdx attempted to download and install several operating software updates. software updates on a kindle are usually in the background, and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboots. consistent with the fire hd, it crashed during setup, playing a song, watching a tv show, and reading a book. it took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues.screen display / video playback:this version of the fire has the absolute best screen display of any fire model to date. looking at the technical specs amazon made some major changes in the display / resolution, and the picture appears more crisp: i compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the fire devices over the past couple of years - don't laugh - the first episode of the wonder woman tv series from the 70's. the display on this fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the fire hd. for you technical folks out there, the display is 1,920 x 1,200 with 50 more pixels per inch than the fire hd.wi-fi connectivity:the initial wi-fi setup took some time as it wouldn't remember the password for my router after each software update / crash / reboot series. after the final operating software update i mentioned above, however, it was fairly easy to connect to the internet via wi-fi.my standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side-by-side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of wi-fi in my house and the worst place where it drags. in this comparison, i had this hdx version of the fire sitting next to last year's and this year's version of the hd fire, as well as last year's 8.9 hd fire, motorola razr smartphone, my ipad 2 (yes, the kindle guy uses an ipad for work), and the first-generation 7 fire (the model from two years ago) all just using a wi-fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.my normal website test is to hit the mobile websites of foxnews, cnn, my personalized yahoo page, google, and the houston chronicle. the ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the hdx (houston chronicle and cnn), and for the other sites i couldn't tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router. when i went to the slowest / worst reception location of my house, the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year's model of the 7 kindle fire hd yes, it was also faster than this year's model of the fire hd but i attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the hdx.sound / music playback:the two speakers are located in the back of the kindle fire in two not-noticeable ports: one on the top and one on the bottom. my test of this feature was cranking up van halen's panama to maximum volume (i always want to see if it could really play the guitar licks), and i would alternate covering one speaker up over the other: you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker. the dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass. however, i am still of the opinion the speakers aren't going to do very well being placed in the back as i am in the front: i want to be able to hear whatever i am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room (that's what happens when you start losing your hearing like i am). while the cover for this version has not shipped yet - why aren't the covers released at the same time - i imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers. the x-ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined if you are not, it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away.email setup:consistent with previous versions of the fire, email setup was very easy for my main gmail account, both with the software came with the fire but my primary use of an existing app called enhanced email i purchased here in the amazon app store. i did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem - it took about a minute to setup my main google account - and i was able to send and receive emails as well as synch my online calendar via google's calendar and contacts. for those of you asking yourself why am i using the enhanced email program, the simple answer is like many of you i have more than one email account: you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool. the lazy person in me appreciates that as i don't like getting out of the lazy chair once i'm settled innew tabs and screen layout:in addition to the normal tabs amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner. interestingly, and consistent with my experiences with this year's model of the fire hd, i purchased the one with special offers and the only ad i have seen so far is on the main screen saver vs. being overwhelmed with ads like last year's model.reading books:turning pages is pretty darn easy - just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page, or you can swipe your finger across the screen to do the same. amazon did add the feature to see the book's description for books on your device like they have with the e-ink kindle (always an annoyance with last year's model), which is a plus as i can't remember what each book in my digital to-be-read pile is about getting to the book description, requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be. if there is an easier way to do it, i can't find it and maybe i should be one of the first guys, ever, to crack open the electronic user's manual to figure it out (doubt it). for those of you who have wondered, you still can't organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third-party app/a here in the amazon app store.bluetooththere is a bluetooth connection, and i did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the fire stream music through my car stereo. there were no delays or skips with the connection, and it paired up in about a minute. just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized.camera:there is a camera on this model - it faces the front or toward the user / reader. focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy, and amazon will by default store your pictures in the cloud - which counts against your storage allotment. i'd recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it, because if you go over the limit that will provide amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you.charger:unlike previous models of the fire, this one does include a charger if you're scratching your head with that comment, in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for 20 which always seemed kind of silly for amazon to do.mayday button:a new feature with this model, and not included on this year's regular model of the fire, is the introduction of the mayday button. basically, you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see - and talk to - a live customer service agent. i haven't pressed the button yet to try it out, as i think i would feel pretty dumb: when they ask me how can they help, i don't want to say i just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say hi' for purposes of this review.what i wish it had: a case that was ready to go and shipped when the fire was ready (why are we waiting). a case is very important in order to protect your investment. also, i'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance i mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.overall, at 229 for the 16gb of memory model (309 for 64 gb of memory) i think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature. kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch tv and movies, and a whole lot of other things. adults should like it for the exact same reasons, but while i try to minimize the amount of work-related stuff i do at home with the business apps that are available here in the amazon app store and other places around the internet i can also work on excel and word-compatible files when i have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be. if you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model fire, i would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 gb. if you're comparing last year's hd model to this version and it is operating fine, or looking for a tablet for your younger children, i'd say save your money and continue to get your money's worth out of last year's model or get this year's model of the kindle fire hd at 139. read more kindle fire hdx 7"" nan amazon devices,kindle store,buy a kindle",4.0
462,6,"excellent 3rd-generation tablet that compares favorably to the competition this is the middle model of the three models that amazon is shipping this year: the kindle fire hd, the kindle fire hdx (this tablet), and the kindle fire hdx 8.9. this is the successor for last year's kindle fire hd but with an updated operating system and new features, a redesigned shell (with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible), an absolutely amazing display, superb sound, an included power adapter, and the new mayday feature. see http://www.amazon.com/review/rnh700dom9wn3/ for my review of the kindle fire hd and http://www.amazon.com/review/r2ypithvtylczt for my review of the kindle fire hdx 8.9.update: some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the hdx. if you search on youtube for hdx blue haze, you can find a video showing the issue. amazon has updated their learn more link with the following info:to achieve the perfect color accuracy on kindle fire hdx 7 at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, leds. blue leds allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20 improvement in power efficiency.as a result of using these blue leds, you may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. all displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the kindle fire hdx 7 is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy.if this is something that you think would bother you, i'd recommend taking a look at the youtube video or taking a look at the hdx at a local best buy or office superstore. i've also uploaded a user image here of my hdx with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/b00dopno4m/).the amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices, best suited for connecting to the amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, and so on. with the free prime trial subscription, you can check out the prime instant video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for 30 days. for videos, music, and books, the amazon selection is at or near the top of the list for apps, much less so. 90 of the top 100 apps are available on amazon.com, as well as 100,000 others, but that's only a small fraction of what is available with google or apple.it's not quite as bad as it sounds because, while the competition has ten times as many apps, most of those apps are, um ... how shall i put this ... less than stellar (look up sturgeon's law). if there are specific apps you need or want, you definitely should double-check before purchasing to make sure that they are available. the apps that will likely never become available on the kindle fire ecosystem are those apps that require google services (i.e., anything that uses google location services). one ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side-load most of the apps from the google play store onto an amazon tablet and a web search on side-loading apps onto kindle fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions. if the app you are sideloading requires a google service to work, though, it will not run on the fire, even if you manage to successfully install it.like the other kindle fire tablets, as well as the apple ipad and the google nexus, the kindle tablet line doesn't have a micro-sd slot, so the assumption is that you're consuming content from the cloud. this is fine when you're using your tablet with wifi not so good when you're traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip. if the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32gb or 64gb versions, or pay the additional price for the 4g version, which is available on the 7 tablet for the first time. also, if all of your content is on itunes or on google play, you would have to side-load everything onto the tablet. as is true of apple and google tablets, there's no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition.something new this year is the ability to download prime instant videos. i verified that i can download prime instant videos to my kindle fire hdx. however, that option is not available for all movies and tv shows. it looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes. so, for example, i was able to download casablanca but not able to download the avengers even though both are part of the prime instant video collection and both are available for free streaming.update: adding a bit from a reply in the comments: amazon is clearly looking at the enterprise market with this launch, at least based on the details they provide. they've added full accessibility support (required in order to get government contracts), will be bringing support for vpn and business printing, have a better email client with tighter integration to exchange, and are including officesuite for productivity. there are other productivity tools available in their app store, as well, although both google and apple, particularly the latter, have more options. when vpn support arrives, i'll definitely be taking a look, as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night.so how does this kindle fire hdx differ from the previous generation kindle fire hddisplay: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). it's more than that, though, as the colors are richer, brighter, with better contrast. this display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and i would have to agree. amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight. while there is definitely a noticeable improvement, this isn't what you need for reading on the beach. for that, you'll need an eink reader like the kindle paperwhite.sound: as far as i can tell, the sound is about the same. this was already one of the best-sounding tablets on the market, with dolby stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones.size and weight: noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) and noticeably smaller (7.3 x 5.0 x 0.35 vs. 7.6 x 5.4 x 0.4). this is a comfortable tablet to hold one-handed, even for long periods of time.processor: it's a *lot* faster (2.2ghz quad-core, top-of-the-line cpu, compared to 1.2ghz dual-core). this tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class. every game i've tried on it has run smoothly, with no hesitations, slowdowns, or glitches. scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now, without the hesitations and occasional slowdowns of the previous generations.build: a redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find this is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet. since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.camera: if there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, i'm not able to see it. it's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or skype. like last year's model, there is no rear camera. if this is important to you, you'll need the 8.9 version.hdmi output: this is the one area where last year's model wins. amazon has removed the hdmi out connector from its tablet line (but see the description above for details on how amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television). no other tablet that i'm aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need, you should be able to purchase one of last year's models fairly cheaply.battery life: the same, at 11 hours. however, amazon has added a special reading mode to the device, which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as 17 hours. i did not test this. for my own personal use, the battery life is adequate.price: it's more expensive (229 vs. 199) but this year they include a power adapter, which was a 20 extra last year, so the actual difference in price is 10. for what you're getting, that price increase is definitely justified.it has an updated os and updated feature software (including the free unlimited mayday customer support feature). the software updates include the ability to download some prime instant videos to your device and watch them offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls and features (so now it's better suited for office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved x-ray features (now including lyrics for music, as well as additional information for both books and movies), integration with goodreads (coming soon), and the like.where i noticed the biggest difference was the home screen. the default view is still the carousel but if you swipe upward, you'll see a more traditional icon view. the recommended for you display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings). amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.there is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app. if you tap the center of your display and then swipe left while you're reading a book, for example, you'll see a panel that shows you the table of contents, the about the author link, the sync to furthest page read link, and so on.the kindle freetime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business. if you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access, how long they can use the tablet at any given time, and the like, amazon has you covered.you can now also schedule quiet time on the tablet, where notification sounds and pop-up notifications are disabled, either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis. frankly, i doubt i'll ever use this feature but if you're the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep, it's kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don't get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays a new word in your words with friends game.mayday: this is a huge gamble by amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off. this isn't a feature for a techie like me and i didn't use it (although i was sorely tempted). from the commercials, it's pretty amazing, particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less (amazon's goal is something like 15 seconds, i believe, although i can't help wondering what will happen on christmas day). if you're thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe, the addition of this feature may make the kindle fire hdx your best choice.how does this tablet rank against the competition there are really only two other tablets in its class currently: the google nexus 7 and the just-announced apple ipad mini with retina display.display: all three devices have retina displays, with the 7 hdx and the nexus at 1920x1200 (323 ppi) and the 8 ipad mini at 2048x1536 (326 ppi). all three displays are stunning. amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight, something that's a problem for all such devices. while this wouldn't be my first choice to read by the pool (i'd pick the paperwhite), i can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors.it's worth noting that the aspect ratio of the hdx and nexus is 16:10 while the aspect ratio of the ipad mini is 4:3. where this matters is watching video. if you're watching an old television show, a 4:3 aspect ratio is fine. if you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the hdx and nexus. apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up.sound: the hdx has dolby digital surround sound the nexus has frauenhofer surround sound the ipad mini has stereo sound. the ipad mini also makes the same mistake that amazon made in its first-generation tablet: putting both speakers on the same side (in this case, at the bottom of the tablet). if you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side. the hdx, in contrast, has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching.networking: the hdx and the ipad mini both have dual band, dual antenna (mimo) wi-fi. the nexus is dual band but not dual antenna. all things being equal, i would expect the nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.size and weight:hdx: 7.3 x 5.0 x 0.35 and 10.7 oz.nexus: 7.9 x 4.5 x 0.34 and 10.24 oz.ipad mini: 7.87 x 5.3 x 0.29 and 11.68 oz.there's really nothing to choose from here. all three are small, thin, and light. the ipad mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.processor:hdx: 2.2 ghz quad-core snapdragon 800 processor, 2gb memorynexus: 1.5ghz quad-core snapdragon s4 pro, 2gb memoryipad mini: 64-bit dual-core a7, 1gb memorythe hdx and ipad come out ahead of the nexus on processing power while the hdx and nexus come out ahead of the ipad mini on memory. the a7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core snapdragon. these are all pretty powerful tablets.cameras: both the nexus and the ipad mini have 1.2 mp front and 5mp rear cameras. the hdx only has a front-facing camera. if you expect to take pictures with your tablet, the hdx isn't for you.battery life: hdx 11 hours (17 hours when reading) nexus 9 hours ipad mini 10 hours. amazon wins this one, particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading.expansion: none of them have a microsd slot they all assume that you'll be using their respective cloud systems.parental controls: all of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child's access to content, purchases, the web, and so on. amazon goes farther, though, with the kindle free time and kindle free time unlimited options, the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content. if you are buying a first tablet for a child, i'd choose the kindle fire hd. at only 139, it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the hdx has.enterprise: as soon as amazon releases its update, it will add vpn and network printing support. i believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities, including that support and various office apps. for real productivity, though, personally i'd go with a laptop, not a tablet.support: amazon wins this category, hands down, with the new mayday system. apple comes in second, with apple and amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey. this is an area where google does not shine.price: the hdx and nexus win this one, hands down. both are priced at 229 vs. 399 for the new ipad mini. neither google nor amazon makes much, if any, money on their tablets they're counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores.from my own perspective, there is no single clear winner, as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses. if you already have amazon prime, the hdx is a no-brainer, with the access to the prime instant video and the kindle owners' lending library. if you're primarily buying a tablet to read with, amazon wins there, as well, with the 17-hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors. if you want apps, apple and google both have far more choices. if you want to watch movies, i'd pick either the hdx or the nexus, as apple's aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack. if price is a factor, then you should pick either the hdx or the nexus.if you're heavily invested in the apple ecosystem, i.e., you already own an iphone or ipad and all of your content is on itunes, the hdx really isn't the tablet for you. similarly, if you love browsing google play for apps to play on your samsung galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on amazon (although, as i note above, most of the google play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet). if you love your google now or siri, neither of which will ever be available on amazon, this isn't the tablet for you.the bottom line: this tablet is primarily intended as a viewport into amazon content and amazon services. if you have amazon prime and you have amazon ebooks in your collection, this tablet is a no-brainer. the price is low, particularly for what you get, and it's a small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound. this really is one of the top tablets in its class.note: as others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi. unlike some others, i had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes. it took several minutes but the process ran smoothly, as did the tablet when everything was done.update:now that i have a kindle fire hd and a kindle fire hdx tablet, i'm in a little better position to talk about which one i'd recommend:you should get the kindle fire hdx if:- you're a techie who wants the latest and greatest, the best display, the fastest processor.- you need a camera for skype or other video app.- you play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- the size and weight matter to you, even in such small increments as this.- you think you will need the mayday technical support.you should get the kindle fire hd if:- price is a factor. 90 cheaper is not an insignificant amount. this really is an excellent value for the money.- you want an inexpensive tablet for a child (and, for this case, the lack of a camera might well be a plus)- all you want is a basic tablet for reading books, playing music, watching the occasional video, playing words with friends, and the like. while the screen on the hd isn't as stunning as is it on the hdx, this is still a true hd screen and it is very good.i check back pretty regularly, so if you have a question, please feel free to ask and i'll do my best to answer it. read more kindle fire hdx 7"" nan amazon

166,34,"the echo's little sister is amazing!! 3, important update (3/8/17): as you read my original review, please be aware that amazon announced in early february (2017) a new firmware update that allows amazon tap owners to enable a hands-free option! by going into settings in the alexa app, you can now choose the hands-free option and have your tap respond to voice commands without touching it, just like the echo and echo dot! this is a fabulous development and something tap owners have been hoping for. thank you, amazon!since the lack of hands-free operation was the one major shortcoming of the tap, this wonderful little device has now gotten a whole lot better. one thing to keep in mind, though, especially if you use your tap on battery power: the hands-free mode will drain the battery more quickly, because it requires the microphone to be on at all times. but since you can easily toggle between hands-free or regular tap mode using the alexa app, you can pick and choose how you want to use your tap for maximum battery life and convenience.-------------------------i admit that i was a little skeptical when amazon first introduced its echo device. but i decided to buy one anyway, thinking that if i didn't like it i could easily sell it. after all, back in the early days of the echo it was in very high demand. so the financial risk associated with trying it was minimal. today, as an avid music listener who loves to cook, i'm thrilled that i decided to give the echo a try.i had wanted a device that i could stream music with in the kitchen, and the echos hands-free voice control made it very appealing. but how would it sound that question was quickly answered as soon as i set up and started using my echo.read more amazon tap - alexa-enabled portable bluetooth speaker amazon amazon devices,home,smart home & connected living,smart hubs & wireless routers,smart hubs,home improvement,home safety & security,alarms & sensors,home security,amazon echo,home, garage & office,smart home,voice assistants,amazon tap,electronics features,tvs & electronics,portable audio & electronics,mp3 player accessories,home theater & audio,speakers,featured brands,electronics,kindle store,frys,electronic components,home automation,electronics, tech toys, movies, music,audio,bluetooth speakers",5.0

512,34,"amazon tap review - best bluetooth speaker in its category 2, the amazon tap is a portable bluetooth speaker that can be controlled with your voice. you can instruct it to play music, order products and services, control home automation products and connected devices, plus a whole lot more.it contains a button activated microphone for listening to your verbal commands. it also has dolby stereo speakers for playing music. the amazon tap is basically the portable version of the popular amazon echo that was released last year.ive been testing the tap for several days now. heres what i think so far: what i like i find that the tap understands my verbal commands accurately. this could be due to the fact that, since its button activated, im always very close to the device when i speak to it. nevertheless, its nice that tap understands me the first time. this was my experience with the amazon echo as well.the audio is surprisingly good for such a small device. i test portable speakers all the time and id say the amazon tap is as good as or better than the speakers in its price range. don't expect bose type sound or deep bass levels, however.no other portable speaker device offers voice control and wi-fi streaming. thus the amazon tap offers a tremendous amount of value over similarly priced portable speakers. this is especially true if you already have amazon prime and prime music.it supports many great services. like the amazon echo that came before it, the amazon tap supports popular music services such as prime music, spotify, pandora, iheartradio, and tunein.battery life has been good so far. i used it off and on for a couple days without charging it. ill post an update once i have come closer to testing the limits of the battery life.read more amazon tap - alexa-enabled portable bluetooth speaker amazon amazon devices,home,smart home & connected living,smart hubs & wireless routers,smart hubs,home improvement,home safety & security,alarms & sensors,home security,amazon echo,home, garage & office,smart home,voice assistants,amazon tap,electronics features,tvs & electronics,portable audio & electronics,mp3 player accessories,home theater & audio,speakers,featured brands,electronics,kindle store,frys,electronic components,home automation,electronics, tech toys, movies, music,audio,bluetooth speakers",5.0

(if you want hands free use, you may want the big brother echo device, which is hands free, but tethered in place by a power cord, so not portable). the feel of the tap with the black fabric cover is nice, and will not slip out of your hand. the fabric is like tough upholstery cover, so it won't stain or be easy to damage, but is quite attractive. i am glad they did that, as bare plastic would be easy to drop. i found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless, and it works as advertised! i mostly just use it for playing music and asking alexa silly questions for fun! i occasionally use it for shopping lists, which shows up on my phone, and checking the weather. who knows what the future holds,when i have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do? i understand that amazon plans to add more alexa skills all the time, and if one got into smart house control with compatible products, the tap would eliminate all remotes, which i already have too many of. i think it is a really fun, cool item, and i am glad i got it! it is so much fun to use voice commands instead of typing, especially the tiny smart phone typing ! i could get used to this! i have the alexa app on my phone, which allows certain voice commands to show up on my phone, like shopping lists, to do lists, calendar. the tap can also check traffic, weather, movies, etc directly through wi fi, no phone needed. however, the alexa phone app actually helps you figure out what you can do with the tap. the tap can read audible and some kindle ebooks to you as well! btw, i haven't had any problems having it understand me, which is amazing, since i grew up in texas and expected a problem with my accent. obviously, this item is ideal for people who are amazon prime members, so you can stream prime music, although it also streams pandora and other music services, and does many things without any connection to amazon. i guess the most unique thing about the tap is its ability to stream wi fi music directly, without a computer or phone driving it - that and the voice control. i have paid more for smaller ""just"" bluetooth speakers, so to me, this was a super deal, and continues to be a source of fun and entertainment! amazon tap - alexa-enabled portable bluetooth speaker amazon amazon devices,home,smart home & connected living,smart hubs & wireless routers,smart hubs,home improvement,home safety & security,alarms & sensors,home security,amazon echo,home, garage & office,smart home,voice assistants,amazon tap,electronics features,tvs & electronics,portable audio & electronics,mp3 player accessories,home theater & audio,speakers,featured brands,electronics,kindle store,frys,electronic components,home automation,electronics, tech toys, movies, music,audio,bluetooth speakers",5.0

373,9,"moshi's screen protectors are so good, i choose my devices (in part) by whether they make them for them i like moshi's anti-glare screen protectors so much that the fact that there is one available for the fire phone is part of why i bought a fire phone. i've had these screen protectors on multiple ipads and ipod touches over the years and they're the 1st thing i buy for any device i own (particularly those with shiny screens). i love that you don't have to worry about if you don't get them on right the first time, you can just pull them off and try again. i love that when they get dirty, you just remove it from the gadget and run it under water to clean it off and then put it back on your device.the fire phone does have a smaller bezel than the ipads and ipod touches i've used with other moshi anti-glare protectors, but there seems to be just enough that the protector stays on. (in case you don't understand how moshi's screen protectors work: the only sticky part on them is where it covers the bezel-- the non-screen part of your device.)i also hate shiny screens and these protectors make devices usable which wouldn't work for me otherwise. so glad the anti-glare moshi protector is available for the fire phone (for some other amazon devices you can only get the regular moshi screen protector).i've used this with the default amazon cases without problem-- both the leather one and the polyurethane one. i just put the screen protector on first and then the case. moshi anti-glare no bubble screen protector for the fire phone amazon cell phones & accessories,accessories,screen protectors,cell,amazon devices,electronics",5.0

8,8,"awesome headphones! longevity an issue 1, while i've purchased items from amazon for years, i rarely write reviews. i felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, i have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. i'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. i'll address the three biggest complaints i've read from others:sound quality: i think these headphones sound great. i've never owned an expensive pair so i'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but i've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. i'm not an audiophile or a musician so if i'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, i'm fine with my ignorance. i would say they're slightly better than apple's buds (which i liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). there's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. as far as people saying they don't compare to apple's buds, well i don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of apple's buds that are amazing. but compared to the regular earpods, i think amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. they provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).fit and feel: some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. there's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. i don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if i give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my apple buds.read more amazon premium headphones amdsi amazon devices,corded headsets,electronics features,electronics,audio,headphones,kindle store,kindle accessories",3.0
